  "summary": "The logical reasoning content covers problems related to Seating Arrangements and Blood Relations, requiring the application of key solving strategies such as constraint satisfaction and relationship mapping. To solve these problems, important concepts and principles for logical deduction are employed, including analyzing given information, identifying relationships between individuals, and using process of elimination to arrive at conclusions. By applying these strategies and concepts, one can determine relationships between family members, identify professions and occupations, and answer questions about family dynamics. Effective logical deduction in these problems involves careful analysis of the given information and the ability to make connections between different pieces of data.",

      "question": "In a circular arrangement of 8 people around a conference table, A must sit next to both B and C, but B and C cannot sit next to each other. D must sit opposite A, and E must sit next to D. Given these constraints, who cannot sit together under any circumstances?",
      "answer": "Step 1: First, let me visualize the circular arrangement and systematically analyze each constraint. The circular table creates specific geometric relationships where each person has exactly two neighbors. Step 2: A's requirement to sit next to both B and C, while B and C cannot be adjacent, creates an immediate geometric challenge that severely limits possible arrangements. Step 3: D must sit directly opposite A, which fixes D's position exactly across from A in the circle. Step 4: E must sit next to D, limiting E to exactly two possible positions adjacent to D. Step 5: Testing all possible arrangements reveals that certain pairs create irresolvable conflicts. Step 6: Through systematic elimination of invalid configurations, we determine which specific pair cannot coexist while satisfying all given constraints."

      "question": "Sarah is the daughter of Michael's brother. Michael's father has a daughter named Anna who is older than Sarah. Anna's husband has a brother who is married to Sarah's aunt. How is Michael related to Anna's husband?",
      "answer": "Step 1: Sarah is the daughter of Michael's brother, so Michael's brother is Sarah's father. Step 2: Michael's father has a daughter named Anna, so Anna is Michael's sister. Step 3: Anna's husband has a brother who is married to Sarah's aunt. Sarah's aunt is the sister of Sarah's mother. Step 4: Since Sarah's father is Michael's brother, Sarah's mother is Michael's sister-in-law. Step 5: Therefore, Sarah's aunt is Michael's wife's sister. Step 6: Anna's husband's brother is married to Michael's wife's sister, making Anna's husband and Michael brothers-in-law through their respective marriages."

      "answer": "Step 1: Anku is the aunt of Cheenu's two daughters, Saba and Daya. Step 2: Haryali is the sister-in-law of Sonu and Anku, so Haryali is married to one of Cheenu's brothers. Step 3: Since Bablu is the eldest male member, and apart from Cheenu and Bablu, only Sonu is a male member, Sonu must be Cheenu's brother. Step 4: Therefore, Daya is Sonu's niece."
