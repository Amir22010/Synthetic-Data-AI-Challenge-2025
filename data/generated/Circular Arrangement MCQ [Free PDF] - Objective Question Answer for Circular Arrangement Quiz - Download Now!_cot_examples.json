      "question": "In a circular arrangement of 12 people around a conference table, A demands to sit next to both B and C, but B and C have an irreconcilable personal conflict and refuse to sit next to each other under any circumstances. D, who is A's business partner, must sit directly opposite A. E, D's personal assistant, must sit next to D. F is mediating between two specific executives, G and H. Given these complex interpersonal and positional constraints, demonstrate through systematic analysis which specific pair cannot be seated together in any valid arrangement.",
      "reasoning": "Step 1: Analyze the circular arrangement problem with multiple constraints. Step 2: A's requirement to sit next to both B and C creates a geometric challenge. Step 3: This positioning creates a fundamental constraint that severely limits possible arrangements. Step 4: D must sit directly opposite A, occupying the position exactly 6 seats away in either direction. Step 5: E must sit next to D, limiting E to exactly two possible positions adjacent to D's fixed location. Step 6: F's mediating role and G's and H's positions create additional complex constraints. Step 7: Testing all possible arrangements reveals that certain pairs create irresolvable conflicts. Step 8: Through systematic elimination of invalid configurations, we can determine which specific pair cannot coexist in any valid arrangement while satisfying all given constraints.",

E is the spouse of F and must sit directly across from F. G and H have a business meeting and must sit next to each other, but I and J cannot sit next to each other. Given these constraints, which pair of individuals cannot be seated together under any circumstances?",

Step 2: Determine the position of C and E, as C is opposite to E. Step 3: Use the information about F being third to the left of C to establish the sequence. Step 4: Since G is second to the left of H and not a neighbor of A, we can deduce the positions of G and H relative to the others. Step 5: With A opposite to B, and knowing the positions of F, C, and E, we can deduce the position of D and thus who is to D's immediate right.\n\nSo the answer is: E is sitting immediate right to D."

Step 2: Identify the relationship between Margaret and William's family. Since Margaret is William's father's sister, Margaret is William's aunt. Step 3: Consider the relationships involving William's mother and her father, the artist. Step 4: Analyze the connection through the artist's son (William's grandfather) and his sister, who is married to Margaret's brother. Step 5: Through systematic tracing of each relationship chain, verify the precise relationship between David and William.\n\nSo the answer is: David is the cousin of William because David's mother, Margaret, is the sister of William's father, making David and William first cousins."

A must be between B and C, D and E must be opposite, F and G must be together, and H and I must be apart. Step 2: Consider the circular nature and fixed positions relative to each other. Step 3: Analyze the geometric constraints imposed by the circular table and the requirement for D and E to be directly across from each other. Step 4: Examine the possible positions for F and G, considering they must be together. Step 5: Evaluate the restrictions imposed by H and I not being able to sit next to each other. Step 6: Through systematic elimination of invalid configurations, considering all constraints, identify which pair cannot be seated together.\n\nSo the answer is: H and I cannot be seated together under any circumstances because their separation constraint, combined with the other constraints, makes it impossible for them to be adjacent without violating at least one other condition."
