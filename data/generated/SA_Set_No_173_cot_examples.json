  "summary": "Here is a 3-sentence summary of the document:\n\nThe document presents a seating arrangement problem for various bank exams, where a certain number of people are sitting around a circular table, each owning a different car. The problem provides several clues about the seating arrangement, including the positions of individuals such as Thakur, Prince, Robert, and Samuel, as well as the owners of specific cars like Renault, Ford, and Hyundai. By analyzing the clues, the solution reveals the complete seating arrangement, answering questions about who owns specific cars and the positions of certain individuals, and determining that there are 11 people sitting in the circle.",

      "question": "In a circular seating arrangement of 12 people, A insists on sitting next to B, but C cannot sit next to either A or B. D must sit directly opposite E, and F must sit two seats to the left of G. H is sitting three seats to the right of I, and J is sitting two seats to the right of K. Given these complex constraints, determine which pair of individuals cannot sit together in any valid arrangement.",
      "reasoning": "Step 1: Analyze the circular seating arrangement and identify the constraints. Step 2: A must sit next to B, but C cannot sit next to either A or B, creating a geometric challenge. Step 3: D must sit directly opposite E, fixing their positions relative to each other. Step 4: F must sit two seats to the left of G, limiting their possible positions. Step 5: H is sitting three seats to the right of I, and J is sitting two seats to the right of K, creating additional constraints. Step 6: Test all possible arrangements, considering the circular nature and fixed positions. Step 7: Through systematic elimination of invalid configurations, determine which pair of individuals cannot sit together in any valid arrangement.",
      "answer": "Based on the constraints, C and A cannot sit together in any valid arrangement because their positioning would create an irresolvable conflict with the other constraints.",
