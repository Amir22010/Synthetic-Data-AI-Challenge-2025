      "question": "In a linear arrangement of 8 people, A sits at one of the ends, and B sits third to the right of A. C sits second to the left of B, and D sits at the other end. E sits next to C, and F sits next to D. G and H are the remaining two people, and they sit next to each other. If G is not at either end, who sits to the immediate left of E?",
      "answer": "Step 1: Determine the fixed positions based on the given constraints. A is at one end, and D is at the other. Step 2: B is third to the right of A, so the arrangement so far is A _ _ B _ _ _ D. Step 3: C is second to the left of B, placing C in the sequence as A _ C B _ _ _ D. Step 4: E sits next to C, and since C is already determined to be two positions from B, E must be on the other side of C, making the arrangement A _ C E B _ _ D or A E C B _ _ D. Step 5: Considering F sits next to D and G and H sit next to each other without being at the ends, we have to fit F, G, and H into the remaining spots. Step 6: Given G is not at either end, the only configuration that fits all constraints and allows G and H to be together (not at ends) while F is next to D is A E C B F G H D. Step 7: Thus, C sits to the immediate left of E.",

      "answer": "Step 1: Alex is the son of Ben's daughter, making Ben Alex's grandfather. Step 2: Ben's brother has a son named Chris, who is Ben's nephew. Step 3: Chris is older than Alex, but the exact age relationship isn't necessary for determining the familial connection. Step 4: Chris's wife has a sister who is married to Alex's uncle. Since Alex's uncle would be Ben's child (and thus Chris's first cousin), this makes Chris's wife's sister Ben's child's spouse. Step 5: Therefore, Chris's wife is the sister of Ben's child's spouse, making Chris's wife Ben's niece-in-law or more directly, the wife of Ben's nephew (Chris), which does not directly answer the question but clarifies relationships. Step 6: The direct relationship question seeks how Ben is related to Chris's wife. Since Chris is Ben's nephew, Chris's wife is Ben's niece by marriage.",

      "question": "In a circular seating arrangement, 6 people (Jack, Kate, Luke, Mark, Nancy, and Oliver) are seated. Jack sits next to Kate, and Luke sits next to Mark. Nancy sits opposite Jack, and Oliver sits next to Nancy. If Kate does not sit next to Luke, who sits to the immediate left of Mark?",
      "answer": "Step 1: Identify fixed positions based on given constraints. Jack and Kate sit together, as do Luke and Mark. Nancy is opposite Jack, and Oliver is next to Nancy. Step 2: Since Nancy is opposite Jack, and Oliver is next to Nancy, the arrangement concerning Nancy and Jack is fixed with Oliver's position relative to Nancy. Step 3: Given Kate does not sit next to Luke, and knowing the pairs (Jack-Kate and Luke-Mark), we have to fit these pairs around the table with Nancy opposite Jack and Oliver next to Nancy. Step 4: The constraint that Kate does not sit next to Luke means the pairs cannot be adjacent, implying the arrangement must separate these pairs with other individuals. Step 5: Considering the circular nature, if Jack and Kate are together, and Nancy is opposite Jack, then Oliver must be on the other side of Nancy. This leaves Luke and Mark to be placed. Since Kate cannot be next to Luke, and Jack is already paired with Kate, Luke and Mark must be on the other side of the Jack-Kate pair, but not adjacent to them due to the Kate-Luke restriction. Step 6: Given these constraints, the only way to satisfy all conditions is for Luke to sit to the immediate left of Mark because the alternative would place Kate next to Luke, violating a condition.",

      "answer": "Step 1: David is the son of Emily's brother, making Emily David's aunt. Step 2: Emily's sister has a daughter named Florence, who is Emily's niece. Step 3: Florence is younger than David, but the age relationship isn't necessary for determining the familial connection. Step 4: Florence's mother has a brother who is married to David's aunt. Since David's aunt is Emily (from step 1), this means Florence's mother's brother is married to Emily.

Ben and Charlie sit together, as do David and Emily, and George sits next to Frank. Step 2: David is third to the right of Ava, placing David in the sequence as Ava _ _ David _ _ Frank. Step 3: Since Emily sits next to David, the arrangement concerning David and Emily is fixed with one of them being directly next to the other. Step 4: Given Charlie does not sit next to Emily, and knowing the pairs (Ben-Charlie and David-Emily), we have to fit these pairs around the table.

      "answer": "Step 1: Determine the fixed positions based on the constraints. A sits at one end, and F sits exactly in the middle. Step 2: B and C must sit together, and D and E must sit together. These pairs can be arranged as BC, CB, DE, or ED. Step 3: Considering F's fixed position in the middle, the possible arrangements for the pairs around F are limited. Step 4: To find who cannot sit at the other end, we must consider the implications of each possible pair (BC or DE) being at the end opposite A. Step 5: Since A is already at one end, and given the requirement for B and C to be together and D and E to be together, the arrangement that would prevent someone from sitting at the other end would involve blocking the end with one of these pairs. Step 6: Analyzing the constraints, if BC or DE were at the end opposite A, the other pair (DE or BC) and the remaining person would have to fit around F in the middle. Step 7: The person who cannot sit at the other end would be determined by the arrangement that violates the given constraints when trying to place them at the end. Step 8: Considering the pairs and F's fixed position, placing either B and C or D and E at the end opposite A would not inherently prevent any single individual from sitting at that end, except for the fact that one of these pairs must occupy the space next to the end, due to F being in the middle and the need to accommodate both pairs and the remaining person. Step 9: Since A is at one end, and considering the need to maintain the pairs and F in the middle, the critical factor is which individual would be left out or unable to fit if they were to be placed at the end. Step 10: The constraint that F is exactly in the middle, combined with the pairs and A's position, suggests that the person who cannot sit at the other end is the one whose placement would disrupt the required adjacency of the pairs or force an impossible arrangement given F's central position.",

      "answer": "Step 1: Analyze the given constraints to understand the seating arrangement. Step 2: A sits at one end, and B sits two seats to the right of A, so there must be one person between A and B. Step 3: C sits at the other end, which means the arrangement has A at one end and C at the other. Step 4: D sits two seats to the left of E, indicating there is one person between D and E. Step 5: Since E is not at either end and has D two seats to its left, E cannot be in the first or second position from either end. Step 6: F sits next to G, and G is not at either end, so F and G must occupy two seats not at the ends.

Step 8: However, given the strict interpretation of 'two seats to the right' in a linear arrangement, B cannot be directly next to A. Step 9: Considering all constraints and the need for a person to be between A and B, and knowing the fixed positions of C and the relative positions of D, E, F, and G, the direct neighbor of A must be determined by who can fit without violating the rules. Step 10: Realizing the misinterpretation in Step 7 and considering A's end position, if B is two seats to the right of A, then there must be one person between A and B.

E must sit opposite F, and G must sit next to H. If I sits next to J, and A cannot sit next to G, how many different seating arrangements are possible?",
      "answer": "Step 1: Break down the constraints. A and B are a unit, C and D are a unit, E and F are fixed opposites, G and H are a unit, and I and J are a unit. Step 2: Since A cannot sit next to G, and considering the circular nature, we must ensure A's unit and G's unit are separated by at least one other unit. Step 3: With E and F fixed in opposition, we have a reference point. Step 4: The remaining units (A/B, C/D, G/H, I/J) can be arranged in different orders around the table, but we must ensure A and G are not adjacent. Step 5: Considering the fixed positions of E and F, and the need to keep A and G apart, the arrangement becomes a matter of placing the units around the table while adhering to the constraints. Step 6: Since the table is circular, and there are fixed points (E and F), we treat the arrangement as a linear problem once E and F's positions are fixed, then account for the circular permutations. Step 7: However, upon closer examination, the question asks for the number of arrangements possible under given constraints without specifically asking for a count of permutations, which would normally involve factorial calculations for each unit's possible positions. Step 8: Realizing the mistake in the approach, given the constraints and the nature of circular permutations, the actual task is to understand how these units can be arranged while respecting the constraints, not to calculate permutations directly as the question's phrasing implies a logical deduction of possible arrangements rather than a numerical count of permutations.",

      "answer": "Step 1: First, we need to establish the fixed relationships and positions based on the given constraints. A and B must sit together, as must C and D. Step 2: E must sit opposite A in the circular arrangement, which means E's position is directly across from A's. Step 3: F and G must sit together. Step 4: Given the constraints, we can start by placing A and B together and E directly across from them. Step 5: C and D, and F and G, can be placed in the remaining positions but must adhere to their respective constraints. Step 6: H's position is flexible among the remaining spots not directly constrained by the given conditions. Step 7: To determine who cannot sit next to H under any circumstances, we must consider the implications of each possible arrangement and the constraints provided. Since specific positions for C, D, F, and G are not fixed relative to A, B, and E, and H's placement is dependent on the arrangement of these groups, the key is identifying a person whose placement would always conflict with H's possible positions due to the constraints. Step 8: Considering the circular nature and the constraints, if we place the fixed groups (A-B, C-D, E, F-G) around the table, H's position would be limited by the need to not violate the 'opposite' and 'next to' conditions for the other individuals. Step 9: The person who cannot sit next to H would be the one whose required position (next to or opposite another person) would always be in conflict with H's necessary placement to satisfy all given constraints.",

      "answer": "Step 1: First, let's establish the fixed positions based on the given constraints. A is at one end, followed by B, then C. At the other end, D is followed by E. Step 2: F sits next to C, and since F is not next to B, F must be on the other side of C. Step 3: G sits next to E, and since E is next to D at the end, G must be on the side of E away from D. Step 4: Given that F and G occupy the seats next to C and E respectively, and considering the linear arrangement, the only position left that satisfies all conditions for F and G without violating the 'F is not next to B' rule is for F to be next to C on the side away from B, and G next to E. Step 5: With A, B, C, and F on one side, and D, E, and G on the other, the middle seat must be between C and E, but since F is next to C and G is next to E, the arrangement looks like A-B-C-F and D-E-G. Step 6: Therefore, the middle seat, considering the entire arrangement, would be occupied by the person sitting between the two groups, which would be F, as it connects the A-B-C group with the D-E-G group indirectly through its placement next to C.",

Step 5: Considering the requirement for F to be between B and D, and knowing A is at one end, we can start eliminating impossible positions. Step 6: If B and C are at the end opposite A, F cannot be between B and D without violating the constraint of not being next to A or being at an end. Step 7: Thus, through systematic elimination of invalid configurations based on the constraints, we find that B and C cannot sit at the other end if A is at one end, because it would force F into an invalid position or leave no space for D and E to sit together without violating other constraints.",

Step 3: Given Michael and Olivia are a unit, and Thomas and Sophia are another, with Jack in between these units, we look for who cannot be next to Jack. Step 4: Considering the fixed positions relative to Rachel and the groupings, we realize that since Jack is between Michael and Thomas, and these are fixed pairs, Rachel, being at an end and not part of these pairs, cannot be next to Jack due to the constraints provided, making her the one who cannot sit next to Jack under any circumstance that satisfies all given conditions.",
