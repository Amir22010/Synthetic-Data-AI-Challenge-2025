      "question": "In a circular arrangement of 8 ministers around a table, each representing a different ministry, the following conditions apply: Radha sits second to the right of the representative of Railways, and the representatives of Food Processing Industries and Railways are immediate neighbors. Two people sit between the representative of Food Processing Industries and Nitin. Prabhu and Prakash are immediate neighbors of each other, but neither is an immediate neighbor of Nitin or the representative of Food Processing Industries. The representative of Defence sits second to the right of Paswan, and Ravi and the representative of Agriculture are immediate neighbors of each other. Nitin is not the representative of Agriculture, and only one person sits between Prabhu and the representative of Finance. Shankar sits third to the left of the representative of Law & Order, and the representative from HRD sits second to the left of the representative of Health and Family Welfare. Determine the seating arrangement and identify who sits between Nitin and the representative from Food Processing Industries.",

Matthew, who is Jack's business partner, must sit at one of the ends. Olivia, Matthew's personal assistant, must sit next to Matthew. Given these complex interpersonal and positional constraints, demonstrate through systematic analysis which specific pair cannot be seated together in any valid arrangement.",

Step 3: The only way Kate and Luke can both be next to Jack without being next to each other is if they occupy positions that are not adjacent. Step 4: Matthew must sit at one of the ends, fixing Matthew's position. Step 5: Olivia must sit next to Matthew, limiting Olivia to exactly one possible position adjacent to Matthew's fixed location.
