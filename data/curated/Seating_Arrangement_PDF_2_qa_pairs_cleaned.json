  "summary": "The logical reasoning content covers two types of problems: Seating Arrangements and Blood Relations. To solve these problems, key strategies include constraint satisfaction, where one must carefully analyze the given conditions and constraints to deduce the arrangement or relationships. Relationship mapping is also crucial, as it involves creating a visual or mental representation of the relationships between individuals to identify patterns and connections. Important concepts and principles for logical deduction include attention to detail, careful analysis of the given information, and the ability to eliminate possibilities and make informed conclusions based on the constraints provided. By applying these strategies and principles, one can effectively solve complex seating arrangement and blood relation problems.",

      "question": "In a linear arrangement of 7 people - A, B, C, D, E, F, and G - the following conditions apply: C sits next to D, E sits next to F, A sits at one of the ends, and B sits third from the other end. Given that G must sit next to A and that the pair CD must be separated from the pair EF by at least one person, who sits in the middle position?",
      "answer": "Step 1: Determine the possible positions for A and B, given that A is at one end and B is third from the other end. This gives us two initial configurations: A _ _ _ _ _ B and B _ _ _ _ _ A. Step 2: Place G next to A in both configurations, as G must sit next to A. This results in A G _ _ _ _ B and B _ _ _ _ _ A G. Step 3: Considering the constraint that C and D sit next to each other, and E and F sit next to each other, we can represent these pairs as CD and EF. Step 4: Apply the condition that CD must be separated from EF by at least one person. This means the pairs cannot be adjacent. Step 5: Examine the possible placements of CD and EF in both configurations, ensuring they are separated and that all other conditions are met. Step 6: In the configuration A G _ _ _ _ B, to satisfy the separation condition and the constraint that B is third from the other end, CD and EF must be placed with a gap between them, which can be achieved by placing one pair next to G and the other pair closer to B, but not adjacent. Step 7: Considering the requirement for a middle position and the constraints, the only feasible arrangement that allows for all conditions to be met and for the pairs to be separated by at least one person is when one of the pairs (either CD or EF) is at the second and third positions from A, and the other pair is at the fourth and fifth positions from A, with the remaining person (either part of the pair or a single person) in the middle. Step 8: Given the constraints and the need for CD and EF to be separated, and considering A and G's fixed positions, the middle position must be occupied by the person who is not part of the CD or EF pairs and is not A, B, or G, which leaves us with the person who can fit without violating any given conditions.",

      "question": "Rahul is the son of Rohan's sister. Rohan's father has a son named Raj who is older than Rahul. Raj's wife has a sister who is married to Rahul's uncle. How is Raj related to Rahul's uncle?",
      "answer": "Step 1: Rahul is the son of Rohan's sister, making Rohan Rahul's uncle. Step 2: Rohan's father has a son named Raj, who is older than Rahul. This means Raj is Rohan's brother, and thus also Rahul's uncle. Step 3: Raj's wife has a sister who is married to Rahul's uncle. Since Raj is already identified as Rahul's uncle, the sister of Raj's wife is married to another of Rahul's uncles. Step 4: This indicates that Raj and the husband of Raj's wife's sister (Rahul's other uncle) are brothers-in-law through their respective marriages to sisters. Step 5: However, given the initial identification of relationships, it's clear that Raj himself is Rahul's uncle, and the question asks how Raj is related to Rahul's uncle, which implies asking about the relationship between two uncles of Rahul. Step 6: Since Raj is an uncle of Rahul and the question involves the relationship between Raj and another uncle of Rahul (the husband of Raj's wife's sister), they are related as brothers-in-law due to their marriages to sisters, but more directly in the context of family relations, they are uncles to the same person (Rahul).",

Step 2: Suresh's sister is Anil's mother, making Suresh Anil's uncle. Step 3: Anil's father is the son of Ramesh's brother, meaning Anil's father is Ramesh's nephew, but since Anil's father cannot be Ramesh's nephew (as that would make Anil's father younger than Ramesh), this indicates a generational mistake in initial interpretation. Step 4: Correcting the interpretation - if Anil's father is the son of Ramesh's brother, then Anil's father is actually Ramesh's nephew is incorrect; instead, it means Anil is the son of Ramesh's brother's son, making Anil the son of Ramesh's nephew or Ramesh's grandnephew.

      "answer": "Step 1: Analyze the given constraints to understand the seating arrangement. Step 2: From the information, we can deduce that since Farhan sits at an extreme end and third to the right of Akansha, Akansha cannot be at either end. Step 3: Eshan sits third to the left of Akansha, which helps in fixing the positions relative to Akansha. Step 4: Considering the constraints about the directions people are facing and their neighbors, we can start eliminating possibilities. Step 5: Since Diksha is to the left of Eshan and faces north, and given Eshan's position relative to Akansha, we can start building the arrangement from these fixed points. Step 6: Knowing that Babita sits between Cheena and Farhan, and that Cheena's neighbors face north, we can further refine the arrangement. Step 7: Given that not more than four people face north and the constraints on the neighbors of Akansha and Piyush, we continue to narrow down the possible arrangements.

If A likes reading, B likes writing, and E likes painting, who sits at the other end of the arrangement?",
      "answer": "Step 1: First, let's establish the position of A, which is at one of the ends. Step 2: Since B sits second to the left of C, we can represent this as _ B C. Step 3: With D sitting second to the right of E, we have E _ D. Step 4: F sits next to G, so we can represent this as F G or G F. Step 5: Given that the person who likes reading (A) sits between the person who likes writing (B) and the person who likes painting (E), and A likes reading, we can start building the arrangement with A at one end. Step 6: Since B likes writing and sits second to the left of C, B must be to the right of A to satisfy the condition that A sits between B and E. Step 7: E likes painting and sits with D second to the right of E, so E must be to the left of A to satisfy the condition.

      "answer": "Step 1: Rahul is the son of Rohan's sister, making Rohan's sister Rahul's mother. Step 2: Rohan's mother has a son named Raj, who is older than Rahul, making Raj Rohan's brother. Step 3: Since Raj is Rohan's brother and Raj's wife has a sister, we need to determine the relationship of this sister to Rohan. Step 4: The sister of Raj's wife is married to Rahul's uncle. Rahul's uncle would be either Rohan or another brother of Rohan's, given that Rahul's mother is Rohan's sister. Step 5: Since Raj is Rohan's brother and the question specifies that the sister of Raj's wife is married to Rahul's uncle, and considering Rahul's parentage, the uncle in question would be Raj, making the sister of Raj's wife married to Raj himself impossible as it refers to another individual related to Rahul. Step 6: Therefore, the correct interpretation involves understanding that Rahul's uncle, who is not Rohan but another sibling, is married to the sister of Raj's wife. However, given the direct relationships provided, the question aims to establish a connection between Rohan and the sister of Raj's wife, which would be a sibling-in-law relationship, as the sister of Raj's wife is married to a brother of Rohan, thus making her a sister-in-law to Rohan.",

      "question": "In a linear seating arrangement, eight people - Mita, Niya, Om, Pari, Qiya, Rati, Shri, and Tiya - are seated in a row facing south. There are exactly two people between Rati and Pari. The number of people between Qiya and Mita is the same as the number between Pari and Shri. Om is not a neighbor of Shri, who is immediate left of Niya. Qiya is second to the left of Rati, who is fourth from the right. Mita sits at any corner, and Tiya sits immediate right of Qiya. Who sits third to the left of Rati?",
      "answer": "Step 1: Understand the given constraints and visualize the arrangement. Step 2: Since Qiya is second to the left of Rati and Rati is fourth from the right, we can start building the arrangement from the right. Step 3: With Tiya sitting immediate right of Qiya, we have a Qiya-Tiya pair. Step 4: Rati being fourth from the right and Qiya second to the left of Rati helps to fix their positions relative to the right end. Step 5: Knowing there are exactly two people between Rati and Pari, and considering Qiya's and Tiya's positions relative to Rati, we can start deducing possible positions for Pari. Step 6: Since Om is not a neighbor of Shri, who is immediate left of Niya, and considering the constraints about the number of people between Qiya and Mita being the same as between Pari and Shri, we can further refine the arrangement. Step 7: By systematically applying all constraints and testing possible arrangements, we can identify who sits third to the left of Rati.",

Step 3: Leela's husband has a brother who is married to Amit's aunt. Since Amit's father is Raj's brother, Amit's aunt is the sister of Raj's brother, making her Raj's brother's wife's sister or Raj's sister-in-law's sister. Step 4: This means Amit's aunt is married to Leela's husband's brother, making Leela's husband and Raj brothers-in-law through their respective marriages.

      "question": "In a linear arrangement of 7 people, A sits at one of the ends. B must sit next to C, and D must sit next to E. F must sit between B and D, but not immediately next to either. Given these constraints, who cannot sit at the other end of the arrangement?",
      "answer": "Step 1: First, we establish A's position at one end. Step 2: Since B and C must be together, and D and E must be together, we consider them as single units (BC) and (DE) for initial placement. Step 3: F must be between B and D, but not immediately next to either, meaning F must be part of the sequence B-F-D or D-F-B. Step 4: Considering the requirement for F's placement and the units (BC) and (DE), we realize that for F to be between B and D without being next to either, there must be a specific arrangement that allows for an extra person (either B or D) to be at one end while satisfying all conditions. Step 5: Since A is already at one end, the other end must accommodate the remaining unit or individual that does not violate any given conditions. Step 6: Analyzing the constraints, we see that if B and C are at the other end, D and E must be closer to A to allow F to be between B and D, which does not work because A is at an end and F needs to be between B and D. Similarly, if D and E are at the other end, B and C must be closer to A, which again does not satisfy F's requirement without violating the end condition for A. Step 7: The only feasible arrangement that respects all constraints is having either B or D (but not both, as they need to be separated by F) at the opposite end from A, with the other necessary adjustments to satisfy the 'between' condition for F. Step 8: Given the necessity for F to be between B and D and the fixed position of A, we can deduce that C or E cannot be at the other end because they must be part of the (BC) or (DE) units, which have specific placement requirements relative to F and each other. Step 9: Therefore, considering the constraints and the necessity for a specific sequence that allows F to be between B and D while A is at one end, we can identify who cannot sit at the other end based on the requirement for B and D to be separated by F and the fixed units (BC) and (DE).",

Step 4: Rhea's husband has a brother who is married to Rahul's aunt. Rahul's aunt is the sister of Rahul's mother. Step 5: Given that Rhea is Rahul's mother's sister, Rhea's husband's brother is married to Rhea's sister, making him married to Rohan's sister (Rahul's mother). Step 6: This means Rhea's husband and Rohan are brothers-in-law because Rhea's husband is married to Rohan's sister (Rhea), and Rohan's sister (Rahul's mother) is married to Rhea's husband's brother.

      "answer": "Step 1: First, let's break down the given conditions and understand their implications on the seating arrangement.

Step 4: U sits at one of the ends, limiting U's position to either the extreme left or the extreme right. Step 5: V sits next to Q, and since T is two places to the right of Q, V cannot be to the right of Q (as T would then be three places from Q), so V must be to the left of Q. Step 6: P sits next to R, but given R's fixed position relative to S, P's placement will depend on where R is in relation to the ends.

      "answer": "Step 1: Given the constraints, let's start by placing C at one of the ends, as this is a fixed condition. Step 2: Since A sits next to B, we can consider them as a single unit (AB or BA) for the initial placement.

      "answer": "Step 1: First, let's establish Charlie's position at one end of the row, as required. Step 2: Since Ben cannot sit next to Charlie, the person sitting next to Charlie must be either Alex, David, or Emily. Step 3: However, Emily cannot sit at either end, which means she and David (who must sit next to Emily) cannot occupy the seat next to Charlie. Step 4: Therefore, Alex must sit next to Charlie. Step 5: With Charlie and Alex occupying one end, and knowing Emily and David must sit together but not at the ends, they must sit in the middle three seats, with one seat left for Ben. Step 6: Since Ben cannot sit next to Charlie (and by extension, Alex, given Alex's position next to Charlie), and Emily and David are in the middle, Ben must sit at the other end of the row from Charlie.",

      "answer": "Step 1: Analyze the fixed positions based on the given constraints. M must be at one end, and S must be at the other. Step 2: N and O's positions are dependent on M's position, creating a fixed sequence of M-N-O. Step 3: P and Q must be together, and R must be next to them, creating a P-Q-R or Q-P-R sequence. Step 4: Considering the fixed positions and sequences, we can deduce that certain individuals cannot be next to each other due to the constraints on the groupings and the ends.

The following conditions apply: Charlie sits next to Ben, David sits next to Emily, and Alex does not sit next to Charlie or David. If Ben sits at one of the ends, who must sit at the other end?",
      "answer": "Step 1: First, let's establish the known relationships and constraints. Charlie sits next to Ben, and since Ben is at one end, Charlie must be the one sitting next to Ben. Step 2: David sits next to Emily, creating a pair that can be placed as a unit in the arrangement. Step 3: Alex cannot sit next to Charlie or David, meaning Alex cannot be at either end if Charlie or the David-Emily pair were at the ends. However, since Ben (and thus Charlie) is at one end, Alex's restriction primarily affects where the David-Emily pair can be placed relative to Alex. Step 4: Considering the constraint that Alex cannot sit next to David or Charlie and knowing Ben and Charlie occupy one end, the only position for Alex that satisfies all conditions when considering the need for David and Emily to sit together is for Alex to sit at the other end. This is because if Alex were in any other position, given the constraints, it would be impossible to satisfy the condition that Alex does not sit next to Charlie or David without breaking the rule about David and Emily sitting together or Charlie sitting next to Ben. Step 5: Therefore, given the constraints and the need to satisfy all conditions simultaneously, Alex must sit at the other end.",

      "answer": "Step 1: Start by placing A at one end and G at the other, as these positions are fixed. Step 2: Since F must sit next to A, F's position is also fixed, leaving 4 seats in the middle. Step 3: B and C must sit together, and D and E must sit together, creating two blocks of two people each. Step 4: To find out who cannot sit in the middle seat, we must consider the possible arrangements of these blocks. Step 5: The middle seat is the 4th seat in the arrangement. Step 6: If we place the block BC in seats 2 and 3, or seats 5 and 6, the block DE cannot be placed without leaving a single seat empty, which would force either B or D into the middle seat. Step 7: However, if we place the block DE in seats 2 and 3, or seats 5 and 6, the same logic applies, forcing either D or B into the middle seat. Step 8: Considering F is fixed next to A and G is at the other end, the person who cannot sit in the middle under any circumstances would be the one that, when placed in the middle, violates the constraint of having B and C together and D and E together. Step 9: By process of elimination, since A and G's positions are fixed and F is next to A, and considering the blocks of BC and DE, we can deduce that F, being fixed next to A, cannot be in the middle, but this does not directly answer the question. Step 10: Realizing the oversight, the correct approach is to understand that with B and C together and D and E together, and with F fixed next to A and G at the other end, the middle seat's occupant can vary based on how these pairs are arranged. However, given the constraints and the need to maintain the pairs together, the critical insight comes from recognizing that the question asks for who 'cannot' sit in the middle, which implies looking for a person whose presence in the middle would violate the given conditions. Step 11: Since F is fixed next to A and cannot move, and considering the arrangement of pairs, the logic should focus on the feasibility of each person being in the middle while satisfying all constraints. Step 12: Upon closer inspection, it becomes apparent that determining who cannot sit in the middle requires analyzing the constraints' impact on possible arrangements. Given the blocks and fixed positions, the critical factor is the inability to place certain individuals in the middle without disrupting the required adjacencies.",

Step 4: Considering D cannot sit next to A and F cannot sit next to B, possible positions for B and C are limited. Step 5: Since B and C must be together and cannot be at the ends due to constraints, they must occupy the second and third positions or the fifth and sixth positions. Step 6: Given D cannot be next to A and must be separated from C, D's position becomes critical in determining the arrangement. Step 7: E and F, being together, can only fit in the remaining slots that do not violate any rules. Step 8: Analyzing the constraints, if B and C are in the second and third positions, D would have to be in the fifth position to not be next to A or C, forcing E and F into the fourth and sixth positions or vice versa, which does not satisfy all conditions due to the restriction on F not being next to B. Step 9: Therefore, the feasible arrangement that respects all constraints places B and C in the fifth and sixth positions, with D in the fourth position to maintain separation from C and not be at an end.

      "answer": "Step 1: Analyze the constraints given for the seating arrangement, focusing on the fixed positions and the relationships between the individuals. Step 2: Person A must be at one end, and person G must be at the other end, creating a fixed boundary for our arrangement. Step 3: Since person B and person C must sit together but cannot be next to person D, and person E and person F must also sit together, we can start combining these pairs with the fixed end positions. Step 4: Considering the requirement for person B and C to be together and not next to D, and knowing A and G's positions are fixed at the ends, we can deduce possible positions for the BC and EF pairs relative to A and G. Step 5: The middle seat is crucial as it provides the most constraints due to its central position, limiting who can be placed there based on the pairs and the end positions. Step 6: Given the constraints and the pairs' requirements, we can systematically test the placement of each person or pair in the middle seat, eliminating possibilities that violate the given conditions.

Step 2: Identify the relationship between Ben and Charlotte. Given that Charlotte is Ben's father's daughter and older than Alex, Charlotte is Ben's sister. Step 3: Analyze the relationship between Charlotte's husband and Alex's family. Charlotte's husband has a brother married to Alex's mother's sister, making Charlotte's husband the brother-in-law of Alex's mother's sister. Step 4: Since Alex's mother is Ben's sister, Alex's mother's sister is also Ben's sister, or more specifically, another sister of Ben. Step 5: This means Charlotte's husband's brother is married to another of Ben's sisters.

      "answer": "Step 1: First, let's analyze the constraints given for the seating arrangement. A sits at one of the ends, and since it's specified that if A sits at the left end, we need to find who sits at the right end. Step 2: B must sit next to C, D next to E, and F next to G. These constraints create fixed pairs but do not specify their order within the pair. Step 3: G cannot sit next to B or C, which means the FG pair cannot be adjacent to the BC pair. Step 4: Given A is at the left end, and considering the pairs BC, DE, and FG, we need to place these pairs in such a way that respects all constraints. Step 5: The constraint that G cannot sit next to B or C means FG cannot be placed next to BC. This leaves us with limited configurations, especially considering A's fixed position and the need for the pairs to be together.

Step 3: Chris is older than Alex, but this information is primarily to establish a familial relationship rather than a direct answer to the question. Step 4: Chris's wife has a sister who is married to Alex's uncle. Since Alex is Ben's grandson, Alex's uncle would be Ben's son.

      "answer": "Step 1: Rahul is the son of Rohan's sister, making Rohan's sister Rahul's mother. Step 2: Rohan's father has a son named Raj, who is Rohan's brother and older than Rahul. Step 3: Raj's wife has a brother who is married to Rahul's aunt. Since Rahul's mother is Rohan's sister, Rahul's aunt is either Rohan's sister or Rohan himself if considering the sibling relationship. Step 4: However, given the context, Rahul's aunt refers to the sister of Rahul's mother, who is also Rohan's sister. Step 5: Therefore, Raj's wife's brother is married to Rohan's sister, making Raj's wife's brother Rohan's brother-in-law through his marriage to Rohan's sister.",

This gives us two initial configurations: A _ _ _ _ _ B and B _ _ _ _ _ A. Step 2: Place G next to A in both configurations, as G must sit next to A. This results in A G _ _ _ _ B and B _ _ _ _ _ A G. Step 3: Considering the constraint that C and D sit next to each other, and E and F sit next to each other, we can represent these pairs as CD and EF. Step 4: Apply the condition that CD must be separated from EF by at least one person. This means the pairs cannot be adjacent. Step 5: Examine the possible placements of CD and EF in both configurations, ensuring they are separated and that all other conditions are met. Step 6: In the configuration A G _ _ _ _ B, to satisfy the separation condition and the constraint that B is third from the other end, CD and EF must be placed with a gap between them, which can be achieved by placing one pair next to G and the other pair closer to B, but not adjacent. Step 7: Considering the requirement for a middle position and the constraints, the only feasible arrangement that allows for all conditions to be met and for the pairs to be separated by at least one person is when one of the pairs (either CD or EF) is at the second and third positions from A, and the other pair is at the fourth and fifth positions from A, with the remaining person (either part of the pair or a single person) in the middle. Step 8: Given the constraints and the need for CD and EF to be separated, and considering A and G's fixed positions, the middle position must be occupied by the person who is not part of the CD or EF pairs and is not A, B, or G, which leaves us with the person who can fit without violating any given conditions."

Since Raj is already identified as Rahul's uncle, the sister of Raj's wife is married to another of Rahul's uncles. Step 4: This indicates that Raj and the husband of Raj's wife's sister (Rahul's other uncle) are brothers-in-law through their respective marriages to sisters. Step 5: However, given the initial identification of relationships, it's clear that Raj himself is Rahul's uncle, and the question asks how Raj is related to Rahul's uncle, which implies asking about the relationship between two uncles of Rahul. Step 6: Since Raj is an uncle of Rahul and the question involves the relationship between Raj and another uncle of Rahul (the husband of Raj's wife's sister), they are related as brothers-in-law due to their marriages to sisters, but more directly in the context of family relations, they are uncles to the same person (Rahul)."

Step 6: Therefore, Sarah's aunt is Michael's wife's sister, making Anna's husband's brother Michael's brother-in-law through their respective marriages."

Step 3: F must be between B and D, but not immediately next to either, meaning F must be part of the sequence B-F-D or D-F-B. Step 4: Considering the requirement for F's placement and the units (BC) and (DE), we realize that for F to be between B and D without being next to either, there must be a specific arrangement that allows for an extra person (either B or D) to be at one end while satisfying all conditions. Step 5: Since A is already at one end, the other end must accommodate the remaining unit or individual that does not violate any given conditions. Step 6: Analyzing the constraints, we see that if B and C are at the other end, D and E must be closer to A to allow F to be between B and D, which does not work because A is at an end and F needs to be between B and D. Similarly, if D and E are at the other end, B and C must be closer to A, which again does not satisfy F's requirement without violating the end condition for A. Step 7: The only feasible arrangement that respects all constraints is having either B or D (but not both, as they need to be separated by F) at the opposite end from A, with the other necessary adjustments to satisfy the 'between' condition for F. Step 8: Given the necessity for F to be between B and D and the fixed position of A, we can deduce that C or E cannot be at the other end because they must be part of the (BC) or (DE) units, which have specific placement requirements relative to F and each other. Step 9: Therefore, considering the constraints and the necessity for a specific sequence that allows F to be between B and D while A is at one end, we can identify who cannot sit at the other end based on the requirement for B and D to be separated by F and the fixed units (BC) and (DE)."

Step 6: This means Rhea's husband and Rohan are brothers-in-law because Rhea's husband is married to Rohan's sister (Rhea), and Rohan's sister (Rahul's mother) is married to Rhea's husband's brother. Step 7: Thus, Rohan is related to Rhea's husband as a brother-in-law."

Step 3: Alex cannot sit next to Charlie or David, meaning Alex cannot be at either end if Charlie or the David-Emily pair were at the ends.

Step 2: Since F must sit next to A, F's position is also fixed, leaving 4 seats in the middle. Step 3: B and C must sit together, and D and E must sit together, creating two blocks of two people each. Step 4: To find out who cannot sit in the middle seat, we must consider the possible arrangements of these blocks. Step 5: The middle seat is the 4th seat in the arrangement. Step 6: If we place the block BC in seats 2 and 3, or seats 5 and 6, the block DE cannot be placed without leaving a single seat empty, which would force either B or D into the middle seat. Step 7: However, if we place the block DE in seats 2 and 3, or seats 5 and 6, the same logic applies, forcing either D or B into the middle seat. Step 8: Considering F is fixed next to A and G is at the other end, the person who cannot sit in the middle under any circumstances would be the one that, when placed in the middle, violates the constraint of having B and C together and D and E together. Step 9: By process of elimination, since A and G's positions are fixed and F is next to A, and considering the blocks of BC and DE, we can deduce that F, being fixed next to A, cannot be in the middle, but this does not directly answer the question. Step 10: Realizing the oversight, the correct approach is to understand that with B and C together and D and E together, and with F fixed next to A and G at the other end, the middle seat's occupant can vary based on how these pairs are arranged. However, given the constraints and the need to maintain the pairs together, the critical insight comes from recognizing that the question asks for who 'cannot' sit in the middle, which implies looking for a person whose presence in the middle would violate the given conditions. Step 11: Since F is fixed next to A and cannot move, and considering the arrangement of pairs, the logic should focus on the feasibility of each person being in the middle while satisfying all constraints. Step 12: Upon closer inspection, it becomes apparent that determining who cannot sit in the middle requires analyzing the constraints' impact on possible arrangements. Given the blocks and fixed positions, the critical factor is the inability to place certain individuals in the middle without disrupting the required adjacencies."

Step 7: E and F, being together, can only fit in the remaining slots that do not violate any rules.

Step 4: Alex cannot sit next to Charlie or Ben, meaning Alex must be part of the pair with Emily and David or be at the opposite end from Frank. Step 5: Considering the pairs (Charlie, Ben) and (Emily, David), and knowing Alex cannot be next to Charlie or Ben, Alex's position becomes crucial in determining the arrangement. Step 6: If Alex were in the middle, it would have to be next to either Charlie, Ben, Emily, or David. Given Alex cannot be next to Charlie or Ben, and considering the fixed pairs, Alex must be at the end opposite Frank to satisfy all conditions."
