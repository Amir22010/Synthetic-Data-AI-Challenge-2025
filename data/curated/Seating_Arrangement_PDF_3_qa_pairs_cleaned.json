      "question": "In a linear arrangement of 7 people, A sits at one of the ends. B sits next to A, and C sits next to B. D sits at the other end, and E sits next to D. F and G occupy the remaining two seats, with F sitting next to C and G sitting next to E. Who sits in the middle seat?",
      "answer": "Step 1: First, let's establish the fixed positions based on the given information. A is at one end, followed by B, then C. D is at the other end, preceded by E. Step 2: F sits next to C, and since C is already placed next to B, F must be on the other side of C, away from B. Step 3: Similarly, G sits next to E, and since E is next to D at the end, G must be on the other side of E, away from D. Step 4: With A, B, C, and F on one side, and D, E, and G on the other, the middle seat is between C and E, but since F and G are placed next to C and E respectively, the arrangement becomes A-B-C-F and D-E-G. Step 5: The only position left that is exactly in the middle of these arrangements is the fourth position, which is occupied by F.",

Emily must sit at one of the ends, and Ben must sit next to Emily. Given these constraints, who cannot sit together under any circumstances?",
      "answer": "Step 1: Analyzing the constraints, we start with Emily sitting at one end and Ben sitting next to her. Step 2: Since Alex must sit next to Charlie, we consider them as a single unit for now. Step 3: Charlie cannot sit next to David, which means David must be separated from the Alex-Charlie unit by at least one person. Step 4: Considering the fixed positions of Emily and Ben, and the requirement for Alex to be next to Charlie, we find that David cannot be part of the Alex-Charlie unit or sit next to Ben. Step 5: Through systematic elimination, we determine that the pair that cannot sit together is David and the Alex-Charlie unit when Ben and Emily occupy the ends, due to the constraints on Charlie and David's positioning.",

      "answer": "Step 1: Determine the total number of seats, which is given as 19. Step 2: Since E sits in the middle with 5 people on each side, E occupies the 10th seat (as 19 is odd, the middle seat is the 10th seat). Step 3: Knowing F sits 8 seats to the left of E, we calculate F's position as 10 - 8 = 2nd seat from the left. However, considering the arrangement and the fact that F must be 8 seats to the left of E, and given the constraints, we deduce the seating arrangement's specifics. Step 4: The statement about B and C sitting 11 seats apart helps to further define the arrangement. Given A sits next to B, and considering the linear nature and the constraints provided, we determine the specific positions of A, B, and C relative to E and F. Step 5: By analyzing the positions relative to E and the given distances, we find that F indeed sits at the 17th seat from the right, which would be the 3rd seat from the left if counting from the left. However, the question asks for the 17th seat from the left, which requires understanding the arrangement's layout and the relative positions of the individuals mentioned. Step 6: Given the linear arrangement and the details about E's central position, F's position relative to E, and the distances between other individuals, we deduce that the person at the 17th seat from the left must be determined by the overall arrangement and the specific constraints given.",

Step 4: Analyze the possible positions for G in relation to the fixed pairs and ends. Given the constraints, G cannot be next to A or D as those are end positions, and G's placement is dependent on the arrangement of the pairs (B, C) and (E, F). Step 5: Through systematic elimination and considering the fixed positions of A and D, and the paired units (B, C) and (E, F), we can deduce which individual cannot sit next to G due to the constraints provided.",

E and F must sit together, but G and H must not sit next to each other. If A is at one end of the row, who cannot sit at the other end?",
      "answer": "Step 1: Start with A at one end. Since A must sit next to B, B must be at the second position. Step 2: Given that C must sit next to D, they can be treated as a single unit (CD or DC) for initial placement purposes. Step 3: E and F must sit together, so they can also be considered as one unit (EF or FE). Step 4: G and H cannot sit next to each other, meaning they must be separated by at least one person or unit. Step 5: With A and B occupying the first two positions, we have the units CD, EF, G, and H to place. Step 6: To maximize the distance between G and H, one of them should be placed at the end. However, since A is already at one end, the other end must be occupied by a unit or person that allows G and H to be separated. Step 7: If G or H were at the other end, it would force the other (H or G) to be separated by the units, which could potentially fit. However, considering the constraints, especially with E and F needing to be together and C and D needing to be together, the critical factor is ensuring G and H are not adjacent. Step 8: The arrangement that would violate the conditions the most, considering A's fixed position and the necessity for B to be next to A, would involve trying to place G or H at the end in a way that violates their separation requirement. Step 9: The constraint that G and H cannot sit next to each other, combined with the fixed positions and requirements for the other pairs, means that the person who cannot sit at the other end is the one whose placement would inevitably force G and H to be adjacent, given the other constraints. Step 10: Considering all possible arrangements under these constraints reveals that H cannot be at the other end because, with A and B at one end, and the need to keep G and H apart while satisfying other conditions, placing H at the far end would make it impossible to satisfy the condition of G and H not sitting next to each other without violating other constraints.",

      "answer": "Step 1: Given the circular arrangement, we start by placing Alex and Ben together, as they must sit next to each other. Step 2: Since Charlie must sit next to David, we treat them as a unit for initial placement. Step 3: Emily sits directly across from Alex, which fixes Emily's position relative to Alex and Ben. Step 4: With these constraints, we can start eliminating positions for Frank. Step 5: If Alex and Ben are together, and Emily is across from Alex, the positions next to Emily must be occupied by people who do not violate any given constraints when considering the Charlie-David unit. Step 6: Given that each person has exactly two neighbors and the table is circular, the arrangement of Alex, Ben, Charlie, David, and Emily leaves specific gaps for the remaining people, including Frank. Step 7: The critical insight is recognizing that, due to the circular nature and the fixed positions of Alex, Ben, and Emily, Frank's possible positions are limited by the need to accommodate the Charlie-David unit without violating any constraints. Step 8: Considering the fixed positions and the necessity for Charlie and David to be together, the person who cannot sit next to Frank under any circumstances would be the one whose placement next to Frank would inevitably lead to a violation of the given constraints, especially considering the circular arrangement and the fixed positions of key individuals.",

      "question": "Sonia is the daughter of Michael's brother, and Michael's father has a daughter named Anna who is older than Sonia. Anna's husband has a brother who is married to Sonia's aunt. How is Michael related to Anna's husband?",
      "answer": "Step 1: Sonia is the daughter of Michael's brother, making Michael's brother Sonia's father. Step 2: Michael's father has a daughter named Anna, who is older than Sonia, making Anna Michael's sister. Step 3: Anna's husband has a brother who is married to Sonia's aunt. Since Sonia's father is Michael's brother, Sonia's aunt is the sister of Michael's brother, or Michael's sister-in-law. Step 4: Therefore, Anna's husband's brother is married to Michael's sister-in-law. Step 5: This makes Anna's husband and Michael brothers-in-law, as they are married to sisters (Anna is Michael's sister, and Anna's husband's brother is married to Michael's sister-in-law).",

      "answer": "Step 1: With Jack at one end, Kate must be next to him because Jack and Kate must sit together. Step 2: Luke and Mark form another unit that must sit together. Step 3: Nina and Oliver must sit together, but since Paul cannot sit next to Nina, Paul's position is dependent on not being adjacent to Nina. Step 4: Considering the end position, if Jack and Kate occupy the first two positions, we have the units Luke-Mark and Nina-Oliver, plus Paul, to arrange. Step 5: Given that Paul cannot sit next to Nina, and Nina and Oliver must be together, Paul's placement at the other end would not violate any conditions directly, as the constraint is about Paul not sitting next to Nina, not about him sitting at a specific end. Step 6: However, the arrangement that satisfies all conditions, especially with Jack and Kate at one end, and considering the necessity for Luke and Mark to be together, and Nina and Oliver to be together while keeping Paul away from Nina, means Paul can indeed be at the other end without violating any given constraints.",

      "answer": "Step 1: Ramesh is the father of Suresh, and Suresh is the father of Rajesh, making Ramesh the grandfather of Rajesh. Step 2: Ramesh's sister, Nalini, is married to Kumar, and Kumar has a brother named Sunil. Step 3: Sunil is married to Rajesh's aunt. Since Rajesh's father is Suresh, and Suresh's father is Ramesh, Rajesh's aunt is either Ramesh's daughter or the sister of Suresh (Ramesh's son). Step 4: Given that Sunil is married to Rajesh's aunt, and considering the family relationships, Sunil is married to a woman who is either Ramesh's daughter or the wife of Ramesh's son (Suresh), making Sunil either Ramesh's son-in-law or the husband of Suresh's sister-in-law. However, the direct question is about Ramesh's relation to Sunil. Step 5: Since Sunil is Kumar's brother, and Kumar is married to Ramesh's sister (Nalini), Sunil is the brother-in-law of Ramesh's sister, making Sunil Ramesh's brother-in-law as well.",

Step 4: Given C and D also form a pair and must sit together, and considering E and F's positions, the only arrangement that fits all conditions without violating any is having E and F at one end, followed by either A and B or C and D (since both are pairs and their internal order isn't specified), and the remaining pair at the other end.

Step 3: Knowing F sits 8 seats to the left of E, we calculate F's position as 10 - 8 = 2nd seat from the left. However, considering the arrangement and the fact that F must be 8 seats to the left of E, and given the constraints, we deduce the seating arrangement's specifics.

Step 5: By analyzing the positions relative to E and the given distances, we find that F indeed sits at the 17th seat from the right, which would be the 3rd seat from the left if counting from the left.

Step 2: Given that C must sit next to D, they can be treated as a single unit (CD or DC) for initial placement purposes. Step 3: E and F must sit together, so they can also be considered as one unit (EF or FE). Step 4: G and H cannot sit next to each other, meaning they must be separated by at least one person or unit. Step 5: With A and B occupying the first two positions, we have the units CD, EF, G, and H to place. Step 6: To maximize the distance between G and H, one of them should be placed at the end. However, since A is already at one end, the other end must be occupied by a unit or person that allows G and H to be separated. Step 7: If G or H were at the other end, it would force the other (H or G) to be separated by the units, which could potentially fit. However, considering the constraints, especially with E and F needing to be together and C and D needing to be together, the critical factor is ensuring G and H are not adjacent. Step 8: The arrangement that would violate the conditions the most, considering A's fixed position and the necessity for B to be next to A, would involve trying to place G or H at the end in a way that violates their separation requirement. Step 9: The constraint that G and H cannot sit next to each other, combined with the fixed positions and requirements for the other pairs, means that the person who cannot sit at the other end is the one whose placement would inevitably force G and H to be adjacent, given the other constraints. Step 10: Considering all possible arrangements under these constraints reveals that H cannot be at the other end because, with A and B at one end, and the need to keep G and H apart while satisfying other conditions, placing H at the far end would make it impossible to satisfy the condition of G and H not sitting next to each other without violating other constraints."
