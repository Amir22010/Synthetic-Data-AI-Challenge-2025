We have:

Based on the above given information we have:

That means, in case (1) W sits third to the left of T, in case (2) W sits immediate left of T.

S is the only son of T’s brother.
T sits opposite to S’s father and sits second to the left of W’s daughter-in-law.
The one who sits opposite to W’s daughter-in-law sits adjacent to W, who is the mother of R.

family.

Thus, W must be the wife of P.

U is the father of Q, who sits three places away from V.

That means, U must be the son of P, and U must be the father of S.
