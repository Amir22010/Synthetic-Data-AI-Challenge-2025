Common explanation : 

References: 
Certain number of persons is sitting in a circular table and is facing towards the center of the table. 

Some of them own different cars. 

No two persons have same car. 

Inferences: 
From above statements, 

Keep above information in mind while solving this seating. 

References: 
Robert is sitting second to the left of Prince. 

Samuel is sitting second to the left of Robert. 

Inferences: 
From above statements, 

Let the position of the person be numbered as 1 to till last in clockwise direction. 

Let the Prince sits at 1 and then Robert and Samuel will sit at 3 and 5 respectively. 

By using above information we get the following seating, 

References: 
Two persons are sitting between Thakur and Prince. 

Samuel and Thakur are not the immediate neighbors. 

Inferences: 
From above statements, 

Thakur can’t sit at 4 (adjacent to Samuel) 

 
 
 
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
 
  
  
  
  
Therefore, Thakur sits third to the right of Prince as shown, 

Note: Thakur position is known only based on other statements. 

References: 
Qasim is sitting second to the right of Thakur. 

Number of persons sitting between Qasim and Prince, when counted from right of Prince is four times as the 
number of persons sitting between Samuel and Qasim, when counted from left of Samuel. 

Inferences: 
From above statements, 

Qasim is sitting second to the right of Thakur. 

Given, Number of persons sitting between Qasim and Prince, when counted from right of Prince = 4 × number 
of persons sitting between Samuel and Qasim, when counted from left of Samuel 

As per above seating, number of persons sitting between Qasim and Prince, when counted from right of Prince 
is 4 

4 = 4 × number of persons sitting between Samuel and Qasim, when counted from left of Samuel 

Therefore number of person sitting between Samuel and Qasim, when counted from left of Samuel, is 1. 

Thus we can conclude that there are 11 persons sitting in the circle and Qasim and Thakur sit at 7 and 9 
respectively as shown, 

 
 
  
  
  
 
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
 
References: 
The one, who sits immediate left of Samuel, owns Honda. 

The one, who owns Ford, is sitting third to the left of Qasim. 

The one, who owns Hyundai, is sitting second to the left of the one, who owns Ford. 

Three persons are sitting between Thakur and the one, who owns Renault. 

Inferences: 
From above statements, 

The one, who sits at 6, owns Honda (immediate left of Samuel) 

The one, who sits at 10, owns Ford (third to the left of Qasim) 

Prince owns Hyundai (second to the left of the one, who owns Ford) 

Three persons are sitting between Thakur and the one, who owns Renault i.e. either Samuel or the one who 
sits at 2, owns Renault. 

By using above information we get the following seating, 

References: 
Three persons are not sitting between the one, who owns Renault and the one, who owns Honda, when 
counted from the right of the one, who owns Honda. 

Inferences: 
From above statements, 

If the one, who owns Renault, sits at 2, then there are 3 persons sitting between the one, who owns Renault 
and the one, who owns Honda, when counted from the right of the one, who owns Honda, which is not 
possible. 

Therefore Samuel owns Renault.
