1) D sits third to the right of C. As it is a circular arrangement, we can randomly select a seat for C
and then place D accordingly.

English

2) H is not the neighbor of D and C
3) F sits second to the left of H.
It is only possible if we place H to the second to the left of C because only then we can place F
second to the left of H.

4) E and G always sit next to each other.
5) C never sits next to A while D never sits next to G.
Implies, E and G are sitting between C and D. Also, as G is not sitting next to D, implies, G is sitting
next to C and E is sitting next to D. It is also given that A is not sitting next to C, thus, A is sitting
between H and F as it is the only possibility. Also, now that only B is left to be placed, we can place
him tot he left of C.

Clearly, F is sitting between A and D.
