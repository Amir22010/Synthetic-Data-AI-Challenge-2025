Set-3 

Common explanation 

Reference: 

Qiya is second to the left of Rati who is fourth from the right corner. 

Tiya sits immediate right of Qiya. 

There are only two persons between Rati and Pari. 

Inference: 

Based on the given hints following two cases can be drawn: 

Case1 When Pari is third to the left of Rati 

Row/Persons→ 
(Facing South)↓ 

Rati  Tiya  Qiya  Pari 

           ←Right end                                                                                                 Left end→ 

Case2 When Pari is third to the right of Rati 

Row/Persons→ 
(Facing South)↓ 

Pari 

Rati  Tiya  Qiya 

           ←Right end                                                                                                Left end→ 

Reference: 

The  number  of  persons  between  Qiya  and  Mita  is  same  as  the  number  of  persons 
between Pari and Shri.

In  Case1,  Positions  of  Om  and  Niya  cannot  be  ascertained  without  violating  the  third 
hint, thus Case1 Fails here. 

Case2 When Pari is third to the right of Rati and number of persons between Mita and 
Qiya is 1 

Row/Persons→ 
(Facing South)↓ 

Pari  Niya  Shri  Rati  Tiya  Qiya  Om  Mita 

           ←Right end                                                                                                 Left end→

Set-4 

Common explanation 

Reference: 

Eight persons – Amar, Ansh, Arun, Amit, Ashu, Anup, Arif and Anil, are sitting around a 
circular table facing the centre but not necessarily in the same order. 

Inference: 

We will keep this information in mind while solving the puzzle. 

Reference: 

Anup is to the immediate left of Arun. 

Amit is between Anup and Ansh. 

Amar is the neighbour of Ansh. 

Inference: 

After using the above hints, we can draw a following circular arrangement: 

Reference: 

Arif is to the immediate left of Ashu. 

Arif is not the neighbour of Ansh or Anil. 

Inference: 

After using the above hints, we have: 

 
 
  
  
  
 
  
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
  
 
 
  
 
Explanations: 

16. 

Following the final solution, we can say that Anup is sitting third to right of Amar. 

Hence, the correct answer is option B. 

17. 

Following the final solution, we can say that four persons were sitting between Amit and 
Anil, when counted from the left of Anil.

Set-5 

Common explanation 

References: 

J likes Banana. 

The person J is the immediate neighbor of the one who like Brinjal and O. 

K sits third to the right of O. 

One person sits between K and Q. 

One who likes Beans sits third to the left of Q. 

Inferences: 

From above statements, 

J likes Banana i.e. J likes fruits and sits at the corner of the table. 

The person J is the immediate neighbor of the one who like Brinjal and O. Here we get 
two possibilities as shown in seating. 

Remaining statements are given directly; by using we get 3 initial cases as follows 

Case: 1 

Case: 2 

 
 
  
  
  
  
  
  
 
  
  
  
  
 
 
 
 
 
                 
 
Case: 1-A 

References: 

One who sits second to the right of the one who likes Beans is facing N. 

One who likes Cabbage sits second to the right of the one who likes Cucumber. 

One who likes Beans and one who likes Mango are not immediate neighbors. 

One who likes Mango sits third to the right of M. 

Inferences: 

From above statements, 

One who sits second to the right of the one who likes Beans is facing N. With respect to 
the  position  of  the  one  who  likes  Beans,  N  can  be  located  in  each  of  three  cases  as 
shown below. 
One who likes Cabbage sits second to the right of the one who likes Cucumber i.e. both 
are  vegetables.  So  those  persons  are  sitting  in  the  middle  of  the  table.  Already  Beans 
and Brinjal is located in all the 3 cases. So we get only one possibility to place Cabbage 
and Cucumber as per statement. 

One who likes Beans and one who likes Mango are not immediate neighbors. One who 
likes Mango sits third to the right of M. 

Here we get only one possibility in each case as per above statement. 

Note: In Case 1-A and case-2, K doesn’t like Mango; if so then there is no place for M (O 
is occupied already in both cases) as per given statement. 

By using above information, we get the following seating as shown 

 
 
              
 
 
 
  
  
  
 
 
  
  
  
  
  
 
 
Case: 1 

Case: 2 

Case: 1-A 

References: 

There are as many persons sit between P and M as between P and L. 

L and one who like Apple are not immediate neighbors.  

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Inferences: 

From above statements, 

Case-1: P sits to the immediate left of M and L sits to the immediate right of P i.e. No 
one sits between P and M & no one sits between P and L. As per given statement, there 
is  no  place  for  Apple  (L  and  one  who  like  Apple  are  not  immediate  neighbors).  Hence 
this case become invalid and it can be eliminated. 

Case-1-A: Here, the 1st reference point (There are as many persons sit between P and M 
as between P and L doesn’t get satisfied). Hence this case become invalid and it can be 
eliminated. 

Case: 1 [Eliminated] – No Place for Apple 

Case:  1-A [Eliminated]  There  are  as  many  persons  sit  between  P  and  M  as  between  P 
and L. 

Case-2: Here, P sits to the immediate left of O and L sits to the immediate left of K. By 
this two persons sit between P &M and also P & L (given condition satisfied). Given, L 
and  one  who  like  Apple  are  not  immediate  neighbors.   Therefore  P  likes  Apple  and  K 
likes Grapes (only possibility). Thus we get the completed seating as shown below. 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
Explanations: 

21. 

Following the Common explanation, we get "K-Grapes", 

Hence, option C is correct. 

22. 

Following the Common explanation, we get "The one who like Cucumber i.e. L", 

L sit opposite to O. Hence, option C is correct. 

23. 

Following the Common explanation, we get "None is true", 

Hence, option E is correct. 

24. 

Following the Common explanation, we get "Third to the right", 

N sits third to the right of the one who like Banana 

Hence, option A is correct. 

25. 

Following the Common explanation, we get "M-sit in the middle of the sides", 

Remaining 4 persons sit at the corner of the table. 

Hence, option D is correct. 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Set-6 

Common explanation 

References: 

There  are  three  persons  sit  between  Tanish  and  Jiral.  Jiral  sits  third  to  the  left  of 
Vaibhav. 

Bhavin does not sit third to the left of Tanish who doesn’t sit at the corner. 

One person sits between Jiral and Kiansh. 

Rithwik and Kiansh are not immediate neighbors. 

Inferences: 

From above statements,  

o  Tanish does not sit at corner of the table, and then he must sit in the middle of the 

table. 

Based on the remaining statements we get the following cases as follows 

Case: 1  

Case: 2 

References: 

Aadvik is immediate neighbor of Kiansh. 

Bhavin does not sit third to the left of Tanish who doesn’t sit at the corner. 

Bhavin sits fourth to the right of Yashith. 

Inferences: 

From above statements, we get the following case, 

 
 
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
 
 
 
 
  
                   
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Case: 1 [Eliminated] No place: 
Bhavin sits fourth to the right 
of Yashith. 

Case: 2 

Finally,  Rithwik  sits  immediate  right  of  Yashith.  Thus  we  get  the  completed  seating 
arrangement as follows, 

Explanations: 

26. 

The following Common explanation, we get "Rithwik sit in the middle of the table". 

Remaining 4 persons sit at corner of the table. 

Hence, option E is correct. 

 
 
 
 
           
      
    
 
                
 
   
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
27. 

The following Common explanation, we get "Rithwik". 

Relation: Tanish is second to the left of Kiansh. 

Bhavin is second to the left of Aadvik similarly 

Jiral is second to the left of Rithwik 

Hence, option A is correct. 

28. 

The following Common explanation, we get "Only Vaibhav". 

Fifth to the right of Kiansh is Vaibhav and immediate right of Rithwik is also Vaibhav. 

Hence, option E is correct. 

29. 

In  the  following  Common  explanation  it  is  clear  that  Aadvik  sits  between  Jiral  and 
Kiansh. 

Hence, option C is correct. 
30. 

In the following Common explanation it is clear that Jiral sits opposite to one who sits 
second to the right of Rithwik. 

Hence, option B is correct. 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Set-7 

Common explanation 

Reference: 

Hina sits second to right of Mera. 

Hina and Asha have three persons between them. 

Inference: 

Here, we have two possible scenarios in which above hints can be used accordingly. 

Case 1: 

Case 2: 

Reference: 

No one sits between Asha and Fany. 

Desh sits fifth to left of Fany. 

Inference: 

At this point, we cannot fix the position of Desh and Fany according to the above hints in 
case 1 so we can say that Case 1 is an invalid case. 

Here,  we  have  two  possible  scenarios  in  which  above  hints  can  be  used  in  case  2 
accordingly. 

Case 2-A: 

 
 
 
 
  
 
  
  
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
  
  
  
  
 
Case 2-B: 

Reference: 

Desh and Rani have two persons between them. 

Pinu is second to right of Rani. 

Inference: 

After using the above hints, we have: 

If  we  fix  the  position  of  Rani  on  the  right  of  Desh  then  we  won't  be  able  to  fix  the 
position of Pinu second to the right of Rani. Then, 

Case 2-A: 

Case 2-B: 

Reference: 

Number of persons towards right of Asha is one less than the number of persons sitting 
between Pinu and Asha. 

Number  of  persons  towards  left  of  Rani  is  equal  to  the  number  of  persons  sitting 
between Fany and Hina. 

Inference: 

At this point we can see that our case 2-B is contradicting with the above hints so we 
can say that case 2-B is an invalid case. 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
  
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
  
Case 2-A: 

Explanations: 

31. 

Following the final solution, we can say that 19 persons were sitting in the row. 

Hence, the correct answer is option D. 

32. 

Following the final solution, we can say that six persons were sitting between Pinu and 
Asha. 

Hence, the correct answer is option E. 

33. 

Following the final solution, we can say that Fany was fifth to the left of Hina. 

Hence, the correct answer is option C. 

34. 

Following the final solution, we can say that number of persons that were sitting on the 
right of Hina and on the left of Rani were 1 and 4 respectively. 

Required Sum = 1 + 4 = 5 

Hence, the correct answer is option A. 

35. 

Following the final solution and applying the given conditions, we have: 

Here, four persons are sitting between Riya and Rani. 

Hence, the correct answer is option E. 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Set-8 

Common explanation: 

Reference: 

Usha sits at one of the extreme ends of the line. 

Mona sits third to the left of Usha.

Common explanation 

References: 

Herat and Himan sit opposite to each other but does not face each other. 

Herat sits third to the right of Hetav. 

Inferences: 

From above statements, 

Herat and Himan sit opposite to each other but does not face each other i.e. Herat and 
Himan are sitting at the corner of the table and faces away from the centre. 

By using above information, we get the initial seating as follows 

References: 

Herin and Hetav are facing same direction. 

Herin is an immediate neighbor of the one who likes Barone. 

Hiyan likes Perk and sits second to the right of the one, who likes Barone. 

Inferences: 

From above statements, 
Hetav faces inside the table. Therefore, Herin also faces inside the table. 
Thus  we  get  3  possibilities  from  above  seating  as  shown  below  with  respect  to  other 
reference points. 

Case-1: Here,  Herin  sits to  the  immediate  right of  Herat.  Given,  Herin  is  an  immediate

Hiyan  (likes  Perk)  sits  to  the  immediate  right  of  Herin  to  satisfy  the  given  statement. 

Case-2: Here, Herin sits to the immediate right of Himan. Given, Herin is an immediate 
neighbor of the one who likes Barone. If the one who likes Barone sits to the immediate 
left of Herin, then there is no place for Hiyan (Given, Hiyan likes Perk, sits second to the 
right  of  the  one,  who  likes  Barone).  Therefore, as  per  seating  Himan  likes  Barone  and 
Hiyan  (likes  Perk)  sits  to  the  immediate  left  of  Herin  to  satisfy  the  given  statement. 

Case-3: Here,  Herin  sits  to  the  immediate  left  of  Herat.  Given,  Herin  is  an  immediate 
neighbor of the one who likes Barone. If the one who likes Barone sits to the immediate 
right of Herin, then there is no place for Hiyan (Given, Hiyan likes Perk, sits second to the 
right  of  the  one,  who  likes  Barone).  Therefore,  as  per  seating  Herat  likes  Barone  and 
Hiyan (likes Perk) sits to the immediate right of Hetav to satisfy the given statement.

Common explanation 

References 

O, P, S, U, V and Z are seated on row 1 & Q, R, T, W; X and Y are seated in row 2. 

O sits second from the left of S who is not facing north. 

P sits immediate right of S. P sits straight to T facing opposite direction to each other. 

V sits second to the right of P. 

O and R face each other. Y sits second to the left of R. 

W and U seated are at corners and facing opposite direction to each other. 

Inferences 

From above statements, we get 

Note: In each row persons may face north/south. 

We  don’t  know  the  position  of  S  from  extreme  ends.  So  we  solve  as  per  the 
statements without considering number of persons in row as follows, 

i. S faces south and his/her immediate right is P. 

ii. O sits second from the left of S. V sits second to the right of P. 

iii. Note: if P faces south, then V and O are sit at extreme ends of row-1. Therefore no 
place for U to sit at corner. Thus P must face north direction. Then V sits immediate left 
of S. 

iv. P  must  face  north  direction  sits  opposite  to  T  who  faces  south  direction. 
[opposite direction to each other means, if one faces north then the other faces south 
or vice versa] 

v. O and R face each other. Y sits second to the left of R. [If R faces south, T and Y sit at 
extreme  ends  of  row-2.  Therefore  no  place  for  W  to  sit  at  corner.  Thus R  faces  north 
direction  and  O  faces  south  direction.  Both  are  facing  each  other.  Therefore  Row-2 
faces Row-1 as shown below.

Neither Q nor X is sit at the extreme ends of the row. Q is not a neighbor of R. 

Two persons sit between Q and X. 

V is facing same direction as R. 

W and U are seated at corners and facing opposite direction to each other. 

Z and U are facing same direction as Q and X. 

Not more than five persons facing south. 

Inferences 

Note: Clearly from above diagram (we placed only 4 seating in each row), Q is not sit at 
any ends and not neighbor to R. If Q sits second to the right of R, then T and Q sit at 
extreme  ends.  Then  there  is  no  place  for  W  to  sit  at  corner  in  row  2  which  is  not 
possible. Thus  Q  must  sit  immediate  right  of  T  and  X  sits  immediate  left  of  R.  Only 
person in row 2 is W who sits extreme corner and faces the person U. 

i. V is facing same direction as R. R faces north, then V also faces north direction. 

ii. Only remaining person in row-1 is Z who sits immediate left of P. 

iii. Note: [Given: Z, U, Q and X are facing same direction but none of them direction is 
given directly] 

iv. Hint:  Not  more  than  five  persons  facing  south.  [If  Z,  U,  Q  and  X  are  facing  south 
direction, total persons facing south direction becomes 7 including T, S and O which is 
not possible. 

v. Therefore Z, U, Q and X are facing north direction 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
  
  
  
  
  
 
  
  
  
  
 
 
vi. W and U are seated at corners and facing opposite direction to each other. [U faces 
north, and then W faces South direction. 

vii. Y direction is unknown. He/she may face North/South direction.

The following Common explanation, we get "S and O”. 

Hence, option A is correct. 

72. 

The following Common explanation, we get "Both the persons faces North “. 

Hence, option B is correct. 

73. 

The following Common explanation, we get "V and X”. 

Immediate right of O is V & Third to the right of Q is X. 

Hence, option B is correct.

Common explanation 

Reference: 

Eight  persons  –  Navya,  Farukh,  Ankur,  Mangal,  Ravan,  Danav,  Simar,  and  Gopal  are 
seated  around  a  circular  table  such  that  only  three  of  them  are  facing  away  from  the 
centre and the rest are facing towards the centre (not necessarily in the same order). 

Inference: 

We will keep this information in mind while solving the puzzle. 

Reference: 

Navya sits second to the left of Ankur. 

Farukh is not an immediate neighbour of both Ankur and Navya. 

Farukh doesn’t sit opposite to both Ankur and Navya. 

Inference: 

Here,  we  have  two  possible  scenarios  in  which  we  can  use  the  above  information 
accordingly. 

Case 1:  

Case 2: 

. 

Reference: 

Gopal sits third to the left of Navya. 

Danav sits second to the left of Gopal. 

One of the immediate neighbours of Ankur faces opposite direction of Ankur. 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
Inference: 

After using the above references, we have: 

Case 1:  

Case 2: 

.   

Reference: 

Mangal is not an immediate neighbour of Farukh. 

Simar sits third to the left of Mangal. 

Inference: 

After using the above references, we have: 

Case 1:  

Case 2: 

Reference: 

Ravan and Farukh face the same direction as Mangal faces. 

Inference: 

At  this  point  we  cannot  fix  the  position  of  Ravan  and  Farukh  facing  same  direction  as 
Mangal  in  case  2  according  to  the  given  hints  so  we  can  say  that case  2  is  an  invalid 
case. 

After using the above hints case 1 can be redrawn as: 

 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
  
 
 
   
 
 
 
  
  
  
 
Case 1: 

Explanations: 

76. 

Following the final solution we can say that Mangal sits second to the right of Danav. 

Hence, the correct answer is option C. 

77. 

Following the final solution we can say that Ankur sits in front of Ravan. 

Hence, the correct answer is option D. 

78. 

Following the final solution and applying the given conditions, we get: 

Here, we can see that position of two persons is unchanged including Ankur. 

Hence, the correct answer is option B. 

79. 

Following the final solution we can say that Mangal sits third to the left of Simar. 

Hence, the correct answer is option A. 

80. 

Following  the  final  solution  we  can  say  that  only  one  person  sit  between  Ravan  and 
Navya when counted from the right of Navya. 

Hence, the correct answer is option A 

 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Set-17 

Common explanation 

Reference: 

A row of persons facing north direction consist of equal number of boys and girls such 
that boys are sitting at the extreme ends. All the boys except one sit at even positions 
and all the girls except one sit at odd positions. Extreme left end of the row is positioned 
as 1 and the place immediate next to it as 2 and so on. 

Inference: 

We will make a mental note of these informations while solving the puzzle. 

Reference: 

  There is no one to the left of A who is fourth to the left of J who is on immediate left 

of W. 

  H who is not a boy is sitting adjacent to A and X. 
  P sits at an extreme end and is third to the right of F who is a girl. 
  Only two persons are between W and F. 
  neighbours and T is to the immedT and O are immediateiate left of  P with T being a 

girl 

Inference: 

  With the hint that No one is to the left of A, it is clear that A sits at position no. 1 i.e. 
extreme left end and is the boy that sits at odd number position. Rest of the boys 
will sit at even numbered places. 

  The second hint thus confirms P to be sitting at extreme right end and he is also a 

boy. Thus the position at extreme left end must be an even number. 

  Using all the hints we can identify that there are 12 persons in the row, out of which 

6 must be boys and 6 must be girls. 

  With  the  hint  that  H  is  a  girl  and  is  adjacent  to  X,  position  of  H  can  be  fixed  as 

between A and X. Thus H sits at 2nd number and X at 3rd number. 

  Now  we  have  assigned  all  the  odd  numbered  places  to  girls  except  one  and  thus 

occupied six places for girls and 6 for boys. 

 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Reference: 

  Only three boys are there to the right of U, who is a girl. 
  Z is fourth to the right of B who is on immediate right of X. 

Inference: 

Thus position of B can be fixed as between X and J and U is thus seated as in between U 
and F. 

Explanations: 

81. 

From  the  following  explanation  it  is  clear  that  H  is  the  only  girl  that  sits  on  an  even 
numbered position. 

Hence option C is correct. 

82. 

From the following explanation it is clear that three girls sit between X and O. 

Hence option B is correct. 

83. 

From the following explanation it is clear that J is an immediate neighbour of B and W. 

Hence option D is correct. 

84. 

From the following explanation it is clear that there are 6 boys and 6 girls in the row. 

Hence option A is correct. 

85. 

From  the  following  explanation  it  is  clear  that  J  is  the  only  girl  among  the  five  given 
options. Thus the odd one out. 

Hence option E is correct. 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Set-18 

Common explanation 

Reference: 
Eight persons – Heer, Rani, Nora, Anup, Doha, Mrig, Gaur and Shera are sitting around a 
square table such that four persons sits on the fours corner the table facing towards the 
center and the rest of the four persons sits on the middle of the sides facing away from 
the centre. 

Inference: 

We will keep this information in mind while solving the puzzle. 

Reference: 

Nora sits third to the left of Rani. 

Only  two  persons  sit  between  Mrig  and  Shera,  who  sits  immediate  left  of  Nora. 

Inference: 

Here, we have two possible scenarios, in which we can use the above hints accordingly. 

Case 1:  

Case 2: 

Here, we will make a mental note that only two persons sit between Mrig and Shera. 
Reference:  

Gaur neither sits at corner nor opposite to Shera. 

Anup sits second to the left of Heer, who sits third left of Gaur. 

Inference:  

After using the above hints, we have: 

 
 
  
  
 
 
 
 
  
 
  
 
 
 
     
 
 
 
 
  
 
            Case 1: 

Case 2: 

Initially, we have a hint that only two persons sit between Mrig and Shera at this point 
we cannot fix the position of Mrig according the hint in case 1. So, we can say that case 
1 is an invalid case. 

Case 2: 

At this point we can easily fix the position of Doha in case 2. Then, 

Case 2: 

 
  
 
 
     
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Explanations: 

86. 

Following the final solution we can say that Shera sits in front of Anup. 

Hence, the correct answer is option C. 

87. 

Following the final solution we can say that only one person sit between Rani and Shera, 
when counted from the right of Shera. 

Hence, the correct answer is option A. 

88. 

Following the final solution and applying the given condition we have: 

Here, we can see that position of only persons i.e. Rani is unchanged excluding Anup. 

Hence, the correct answer is option A. 

89. 

Following the final solution we can say that Anup sits third to the left of Doha. 

Hence, the correct answer is option D. 

90. 

Following the final solution we can say that Gaur sits second to the right of Mrig. 

Hence, the correct answer is option B. 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Set-19 

Common explanation 

Reference: 

The persons sitting on bench 1 are facing north and those on  bench 2 are facing south 
such that each person of both the benches faces each other. 

Inference:  

On the basis of above hint we can infer the arrangement in which benches are situated. 

Reference: 

Gayu faces Hina, who does not sit at any of the extreme ends. 

Hina sits second to the right of Dia. 

Inference: 

Here we can have following two cases. 

Case 1 - When Gayu sits on bench 2. 

Case 2- When Gayu sits on bench 1. 

 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Reference: 

Bani faces the person who is second to the right of Ahana. 

Ela and Bani neither sits in the same row nor faces each other.   
Inference: 

Note- We cannot place Bani on Bench 2 in Case 1, because in that case second hint will 
get violate i.e. Ela and Bani will face each other. 

Note- We cannot place Bani on Bench 1 in Case 2, because in that case second hint will 
get violate i.e. Ela and Bani will face each other. 

Reference: 

Fiza sits in the same row in which Ela sits.  

Caira sits on bench 1.   

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Inference: 

Clearly we can see that in Case 2, we cannot place Caira at bench 1. Thus it gets violated. 

Thus we obtain the final arrangement through Case 1. 

Explanations: 

91. 

From the following explanation it is clear that Dia and Ela face each other. 

Hence option D is correct. 

92. 

From the following explanation it is clear that Hina sits on Bench 1. Thus is the odd one 
out because all other persons sit on becnh 2. 

Hence option A is correct. 

93. 

From the following explanation it is clear that Ela- Caira is the pair of persons who sit at 
extreme ends. 

Hence option C is correct. 

94. 

From the following explanation it is clear that Fiza is second to the right of Ahana. 
Hence option B is correct. 

95. 

From the following explanation it is clear that Hina-Ahana are not facing each other. 

Hence option E is correct.

Explanations: 

96. 

As Derived in the Common explanation we can see that B, D, Q and R all of them sit at 
an extreme ends but C does not. 

Hence Option D is correct. 

97. 

As Derived in the Common explanation we clearly see that Q and D face the people who 
like red. 

Hence Option E is correct. 

98. 

As Derived in the Common explanation we clearly see that A sits exactly in between C 
and E , S sits exactly in between P and Q Therefore, E sits exactly in between A and D. 

Hence Option B is correct. 

99. 

As  Derived  in  the  Common  explanation  we  clearly  see  that  all  the  given  options  are 
false. 

Hence Option D is correct. 

100. 

As  derived  in  the  Common  explanation  we  can  see  that  all  the  pairs  face  opposite  to 
each other except A and R. 

Hence option C is correct.

Common explanation 

References:  

Qadir sits at corner and facing away from the centre of the table. 

The person sitting to the immediate right of Qadir is sitting at the corner of the table. 

Tarini,  whose  profession  is  Scientist,  sits  second  to  the  left  of  Qadir  and  the  person 
whose profession is Lawyer. 

Umesh,  who  is  not  the  immediate  neighbor  of  Qadir,  is  facing  the  person,  whose 
profession is Doctor. 

Inferences: 

From above statements, 

By  using  above  information,  it  is  clearly  observed  that,  no  one  sits  to  the  immediate 
right of Qadir. 

Tarini, whose profession is Scientist, sits second to the left of Qadir and also, Tarini sits 
second to the left of the one whose profession is Lawyer (as per seating, Lawyer faces 
inside the table) 

Umesh  faces  Doctor.  Umesh  is  not  an  immediate  neighbor  of  Qadir.  Here  we  get  two 
possibilities as shown in figure. 

By using above information, we get the initial seating as follows, 

Case: 1  

Case: 2 

 
 
 
 
  
  
  
  
 
 
  
  
  
 
 
    
 
References: 

Surya,  whose  profession  is  Teacher,  is  an  immediate  neighbor  of  the  person  whose, 
profession is Lawyer. 

Surya is not the immediate neighbor of Tarini. 

Rithesh is not sitting on the edge of the table. 

Inferences: 

From above statements, 

Rithesh sits corner of the table. By this case: 2 get eliminated as shown in figure. 

Case: 1 

In Case: 2 there is no place for Rithesh at any corner. Hence this case is eliminated. 

Case: 2 [Eliminated] 

References: 

The  immediate  neighbors  of  Prakash  are  facing different  directions. The  person  sitting 
on the edges are facing towards each other. 

The one whose profession is Scientist is not sitting to the immediate right of the person 
whose profession is Banker. 

The person whose profession is Banker does not sit at the edge of the table. 

 
 
 
  
  
 
  
 
 
  
  
 
  
  
 
Inferences:  

From above statements, 

Prakash  is  a  doctor.  Prakash  and  Umesh  (both  are  sitting  on  edges)  are  facing  each 
other. One of the immediate neighbors of Prakash is Qadir who faces outside and other 
one is Tarini, who faces inside the table. 

Therefore,  Rithesh  must  face  outside  the  table  (Maximum  2  persons  can  sit  together 
who faces same direction) 

The  one  whose  profession  is  Scientist  is  not  sitting  to  the  immediate  right  of  the 
person whose profession is Banker.  
 Here,  Rithesh  is  Engineer  and  Qadir  is  banker.  Finally,  Surya  direction  cannot  be 
determined,  he  face  either  inside  or  outside  the  table.  Thus  we  get  the  completed 
seating as shown, 

Case: 1 

Explanations: 

101. 

The following Common explanation, we get "Immediate left of Prakash is Qadir, who is a 
Banker". 

Hence, option A is correct. 

102. 

The following Common explanation, we get "Rithesh-Engineer". 

Hence, option C is correct. 

 
 
  
  
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
103. 

The following Common explanation, we get "Cannot be determined". 

Surya faces either inside or outside and his immediate right is either Qadir or Umesh. 

Hence, option E is correct. 

104. 

The following Common explanation, we get "Prakash-Doctor". 

Hence, option C is correct. 

105. 

The following Common explanation, we get "Rithesh, who is Engineer and his immediate 
right is Tarini". 

Hence, option B is correct.

Common explanation 

Reference: 

Twelve  persons  are  sitting  in  two  parallel  rows  containing  six  persons  each,  in  such  a 
way  that  there  is  an  equal  distance  between  adjacent  persons.  In  row-1,  Joshi,  Jaya, 
Jeet, Jamal, Juber and Jina are seated and all of them are facing south. In row- 2, Prem, 
Pinu, Pal, Punj, Poran and Pooja are seated and all of them are facing north. Therefore, 
in the given seating arrangement each member seated in a row faces another member 
of the other row. 

Inference: 

We will keep this information in mind while solving the puzzle. 

Reference: 

Joshi sits third to the left of Juber. 

Neither Joshi nor Juber sits at extreme end of the line. 

Inference: 

After using the above hints we have: 

Reference: 

Prem sits second to the right of Poran. 

Neither Prem nor Poran faces Juber or Joshi. 

Prem does not sit at an extreme end. 

 
 
   
 
  
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Inference: 

After using the given hints above figure can be redrawn as: 

Reference: 

Jeet does not face Prem and Jeet does not sit at an extreme end of the line. 

Inference: 

Here, we can fix the position of Jeet in the above figure as: 

Reference:  

Only one person sits between Pooja and Pal. 

Neither Pooja nor Pal faces Juber. 

Pal does not sit at the extreme end. 

Inference: 

After using the above hints we have: 

 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
Reference: 

Only one person sits between Jaya and Jina. 

Pooja is not an immediate neighbour of Pinu and Prem does not face Jina. 

Inference: 

After using the above hints we have: 

At this point we can easily fix the position of Jamal and Punj in their respective rows. 

Explanations: 

106. 

Following the final solution, we can say that two persons sit between Juber and Joshi. 

Hence, the correct answer is option C. 

107. 

Following the final solution, we can say that Poran is the one that does not belong to the 
group because of the persons Poran is the only one who sits at an extreme end. 

Hence, the correct answer is option B. 

108. 

Following the final solution, we can say that Juber faces Pinu. 

Hence, the correct answer is option D. 

 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
109. 

Following the final solution, we can say that Jamal sits on the immediate left of the one 
faces Punj. 

Hence, the correct answer is option B.

Common explanation 

Reference: 

1. Rachel who is reading Outlaw, is sitting at the third position to the right of Henry and 
is reading one of the novels by same author. 

2. Sofia is sitting at the second position to the right of rachel. 

3. Henry is reading Fugitive and is sitting opposite to that of Hiram, who is facing away 
from the center. 

4. Both Paul and Henry are reading novels by same author. 

Inference: 

  Henry and Hiram are reading the novel by the same author. 
  Paul and Henry are also facing away from the center. 
  Direction and book read by Rachel is given to us, So we will begin with her. 

Reference: 

1. Paul is reading Judgement and is sitting third position to the right of Betty. 

2. Betty is reading Shadow fell. 

3. The person reading Legends is sitting at the second position to the left of the person 
who is reading Shadow hunters. 

 
 
   
  
  
  
  
  
 
 
 
  
 
  
  
Inference: 

Now  if  we  want  to  place  Betty,  there  will  be  two  Cases  according  to  mentioned 
conditions  and  since  four  of  them  are  facing  away  from  the  center,  that  makes  paul 
fouth one who is facing away from the center. Hence Betty is facing center of the table. 

Case (I): 

Case (II): 

Reference:  

1. John is sitting the second position to right of Betty and is reading Legends. 

Inference: 

From reference we can say that case II will be eliminated because to the second right of 
Betty in case 2 the place is already occupied. 

Reference: 

1. The person reading Legends is sitting at the second position to the left of the person 
who is reading Shadow hunters. 

2. Hiram is not reading Scarlet. 

 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Inference: 

Using the hints given above as reference, we get the final seating arrangement as:  

Explanations: 

111. 

Following the Common explanation, it is clear that option C is correct. 

112. 

Following the Common explanation, it is clear that option D is correct. 

113.  

Following  the  Common  explanation,  and  modifying  it  according  to  condition  in  the 
question It is clear that option B. 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
114. 

Following the Common explanation we can see that books written by same author are 
read  by  Henry,  Paul,  Hiram  and  Rachel.  Therefore,  Andrew  is  the  one  not  reading  the 
book by same author, making option E the correct answer. 

115. 

Following  the  Common  explanation  we  can  see  that  Judgement  novel  is  read  by  the 
person who sits opposite to Andrew. 

Hence option C is correct.

Common explanation 

References: 

In  row-1  Sriram,  Tushar,  Uma,  Vivek,  Wasim  and  Xanil  are  seated  and  all  of  them  are 
facing south direction. 

In  row-2,  Mano,  Nirmal,  Oviya,  Parthiv,  Queen  and  Ranjith  are  seated  and  all  of  them 
are facing north direction. 

Tushar sits at an extreme end of the line. 

Xanil is not an immediate neighbor of Tushar. 

Tushar does not face the one who likes Vijay. 

Only two people sit between Tushar and the one who likes Dhanush. 

Nirmal sits second to the left of the one who faces the one who likes Dhanush. 

Nirmal does not like Ajith. 

Tushar does not like Prabhu. 

Inferences: 

From above information, 

• Tushar sits either extreme right end or left end of Row-1. So we get two possibilities. 

• Remaining all the above statements are directly given and can be filled with respect to 
Tushar's position. 

• Nirmal sits second to the left of the one who faces the one who likes Dhanush. Here, 
Nirmal sits 2nd from left end in Row-2 [Case: 1] & Nirmal sits extreme left end in Row-2 
[Case: 2]

No  two  persons,  whose  names  start  with  consecutive  letters  of  English  alphabet,  are 
immediate  neighbors  of  each  other.  For  example,  Binu  is  an  immediate  neighbor  of 
neither Aman nor Chitra and so on. 

The one who likes Vijay sits second to the right of Oviya. 

Inferences: 

From above information, 

• Nirmal & Oviya can’t be the neighbors (consecutive alphabetic name). Therefore Oviya 
must sit in front of the one who likes Dhanush in both cases as shown in seating.

Vivek faces the one who likes Prasanth. 

Only three people sit between the ones who like Prasanth and Rajni. 

Inferences: 

From above information, 

• Vivek sits in the row-1 & faces south direction. Therefore the ones who like Prasanth 
and Rajni come in row-2 & face north direction. 

• In Case-1, Vivek must sit at 2nd from left end in row-1, by this the one who like Rajni 
comes at extreme left end of Row-2 (Only possibility as per condition)

•  Mano  and  Nirmal  can’t  be  the  neighbors  (consecutive  alphabetic  names)  as  per  the 
condition. 

• So Mano sits on the immediate right of Oviya and likes the actor Prasanth. One of the 
immediate neighbors of Mano is Parthiv and Parthiv faces the one who likes Arya as per 
given statement. 

• Finally, Queen (last person in row-2) sits at extreme left end and likes Rajni. Thus we 
get the following seating.

Common explanation 

Reference: 

The  total  number  of  rows  does  not  exceed  7  and  the  total  number  of  seats  was  five 
times the total number of rows. 

The  number  of  persons  to  the  right  of  Hema  who  was  at  seat  number  3  in  the  row 
number 5 was 1 more than the total number of rows. 

Tina was seated at the left most seat in the last row, which was not prime numbered. 

There were three seats between Saba and Tina. 

Inference: 

With  reference  to  the  first  three  hints  it  is  clear  that  the  total  number  of  rows  was  a 
composite more than 5 but less than 7. 

So, the total number of rows will be 6 and total number of seats will be 30. 

The number of persons to the right of Hema will be 7.

Mihir’s row number and seat number were same and it was an even prime number. 

Ranu sits second to the left of Shreya. 

Shreya is on the immediate right of Sanu who sits in row number 4. 

Total number of persons in the top 3 farthest rows (from screen) was equal to 18.

The only even prime number from 1 to 6 is 2, So, Mihir’s row number and seat number 
will be 2. 

The top 3 farthest rows are row numbers 4,5 and 6. 

Sum of the seats in row number 5 and 6 is 15, thus there must be only 3 seats in row 4.

Reference: 

Kavya was on the last seat of the first row. 

The total number of persons in row 1 was thrice of the total number of persons in row 
4. 

Shagun was seated in an odd numbered row except row 1. 

Inference: 

As  total number  of  persons  in  row  4  are  3,  so  as  per  the  second  hint total  number of 
persons in row 1 would be 9 and Kavya sits at seat number 9. 

The only odd numbered row from 1 to 3 except row 1 is row 3, thus Shagun sits in row 
3. 

Thus we get all the 30 seats.

The total number of seats in the multiplex was 30. 

Hence option C is correct. 

122. 

Seat number of Kavya is 9 and seat number of Sanu is 2. 

Required difference = 7. 

Hence option D is correct. 

123. 

Shagun sits immediately ahead of Ranu. 

Hence option A is correct. 

124. 

Sanu is the one who sits on an even numbered seat among the given options. Thus the 
odd one out. 

Hence option E is correct. 

125. 

The total number of persons in the top two nearest rows (row number 1 and 2) is 11.
