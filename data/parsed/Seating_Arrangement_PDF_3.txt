Reference: 
Qiya is second to the left of Rati who is fourth from the right corner. 

Tiya sits immediate right of Qiya. 

There are only two persons between Rati and Pari. 

Inference: 
Based on the given hints following two cases can be drawn: 

Case1 When Pari is third to the left of Rati 

Row/Persons→ 
(Facing South)↓ 

Rati 

Tiya 

Qiya 

Pari 

←Right end                                                                                                                           → Left end 

Case2 When Pari is third to the right of Rati 

Row/Persons→ 
(Facing South)↓ 
←Right end                                                                                                                                 → Left end 

Qiya 

Tiya 

Rati 

Pari 

Reference: 
The number of persons between Qiya and Mita is same as the number of persons between Pari and Shri. 
Mita sits at any corner of the row. 

Om is not a neighbor of Shri who is immediate left of Niya. 

Inference: 
Case1 When Pari is third to the left of Rati and number of persons between Mita and Qiya are 4 

Row/Persons→ 
(Facing South)↓ 

Mita 

Shri 

Rati 

Tiya 

Qiya 

Pari 

←Right end                                                                                                                                  → Left end 

In Case1, Positions of Om and Niya cannot be ascertained without violating the third hint, thus Case1 
Fails here.

Common Explanations (6-10): 

Reference: 
It is known that Cheenu sits exactly in the middle and there is no person to the right of Ishita. 

Inference: 
There is no one sitting to the right of Ishita, means she is sitting at the right most end of the row. 

Reference: 
Dona is not sitting adjacent to either Cheenu or Ishita. 

Inference: 

Reference: 
Dona is fourth to the right of Faria. 

Inference: 
As Dona cannot sit adjacent to Cheenu and Ishita, so, therefore, there is only place left i.e. third from the right 
end of the row for Faria. 

Reference: 
Gaurav and Harish are sitting next to each other. Harish doesn't sit at any extreme corner. 

Inference: 

Reference: 
Esha is the neighbor of Dona but not of Cheenu. 

Inference:  

Reference: 
Anu is second to the right of Harish. 

Inference: 

Now, only Bablu is left to be placed at the only left position. 

Final image:

Common Explanations (11-15): 

Reference: 

Vishal and Karan sit at the corner but they do not sit at the same row. 

Inference: 

Here, we have two possible scenarios in which we can use the above hints accordingly. 
: 

Case 1 

Case 2: 

Reference: 
Sanju sit third to the right of Karan and adjacent to Vijay. 

Shivam sits opposite to Sanju and Anant sits opposite to Ankit but none of them sit at the corner exactly two 
of them sit along the length. 

Vishal is not a neighbour of Vijay. 

Inference: 
At  this  point  we  cannot  place  Sanju  third  to  the  right  of  Karan  in  Case  1  as  doing  this  will  contradict  the 
information that Sanju does not sit at the corner. So, case 1 fails. 

After using the above hints our case 2 can be redrawn as: 

Case 2: 

As it is given that exactly two among Shivam, Sanju, Anant and Ankit sit at the length of the table and we can 
clearly see that Shivam and Sanju are the ones sitting at length of table. 

Now, it is also given that none among Shivam, Sanju, Anant and Ankit sit at the corner. So, we can say that 
Anant and Ankit will sit along the breadth of the table and face each other. 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Case 2: 

Reference: 
Anant, Vishal and Tappu sit at the same row. 
Shiv and Vijay sit in the same row. 

Inference: 
Using  the  above  hint  we  can  fix  the  positions  of  all  the  persons  in  the  table  and  can  complete  the 
arrangement. 

Case 2: 

11.    Following the final solution we can say that Ankit sits to the immediate left of Vijay. 

Hence, the correct answer is option E. 

12. 

Following the final solution we can say that Sanju is the one that does not belong to the group because 
except Sanju all the other persons were sitting in the same row. 

Hence, the correct answer is option C. 

13. 

Following the final solution we can say that Anant was sitting third to the left of Shivam. 

Hence, the correct answer is option D. 

14.    Following the final solution we can say that minimum number of persons sitting between Tappu and 

Shivam was one. 
Hence, the correct answer is option C. 

15. 

Following the final solution we can say that Karan was sitting second to the right of Rajat. 
Hence, the correct answer is option A. 

 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
  
 
  
Common Explanations (16-20): 

Reference: 
Yellow box is of 26 kg. 
The box weighing 26 kg and 19 kg are not immediate neighbors. 
Only one box is there between Yellow and White boxes. 
Grey box is third to the left of Yellow box. 
Brown box is second to the left of Grey box. 

Inference: 
Following two cases can be drawn from the above hints. 

Case 1 

Case 2 

Reference: 
Black box which is the fourth highest weighted box in the group is immediately heavier than Violet box but 
immediately lighter than Red box. 
White box is neither the heaviest not the lightest. 
The sum of White box and Brown box is 62 kg. 

Inference: 
From the given weights (in kg) - 19, 23, 26, 28, 31, 38, 43 and 49, the fourth highest weight is 31 kg. 
So, the weight of Black box is 31 kg, which is immediate heavier than violet box i.e. 28 kg. and immediate 
lighter than Red box i.e. 38 kg. 
Weight of white box can’t be either 49 kg. or 19 kg. 
So it’s weight should be among the remaining weights – 19, 23 and 43 kg. 
With the available options, the only combination that makes the sum of 62 kg is 19 and 43. 
So the weights of brown and white boxes are 19 and 43 kg respectively. 

We will use some of these weights in the coming hints. 

Case 1 

Case 2 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Reference: 
Black box is third to the left of the box weighing 38 kg. 
The box weighing 38 kg is a neighbor of both Brown box and Grey box. 
Pink box is second to the right of Red box. 

Inference: 
Thus case2 gets eliminated, as position of white and pink boxes clashes here. 
We have already derived the weight of red box as 38 kg, so placing the value in the Case 1 of the following 
arrangement. 

So, we will continue with case 1 only. 

Reference: 
Box weighing 49 kg is second to the left of Violet box. 

Inference: 
The remaining vacant position is assigned to Violet box, which ascertains the weight sof Pink box as 43 kg. and 
Grey box as 49 kg. We had already inferred the weight of violet box, so the final arrangement will look like 
this.

16.    Following the common explanation, we get that the box between the box weighing 38 kg i.e. Red box 

and Pink box is "Grey box i.e. the box weighing 49 kg." 

Hence option B is correct. 

17. 

18. 

Following the common explanation, it is clear that "Grey box is third to the right of the box weighing 26 
kg" is the only true statement. 

Hence option A is correct. 

Following the common explanation, it is clear that "Red box is the odd one out, as the weights of all 
other given boxes are odd numbers except the weight of Red box, which is an even number." 

Hence option D is correct. 

19.    Following the common explanation, it is clear that the weight of black box is 31 kg and the weight of 

white box is 43 kg. 

Thus the required sum i.e. 31 + 43 = 74 kg. is obtained. 

Hence option C is correct. 

20. 

Following the common explanation, it is clear that the third lightest box is Yellow box i.e. the box which 
is third to the right of the heaviest box. 

Hence option B is correct.

Common Explanations (21-25): 
Reference: 
Only 3 persons sit to the left of R. 

3 persons sit between R and Q. 

Inference: 
As we don’t know that in which direction exactly R is facing. So, we can say that there possible scenarios in 
which we can use the above information correctly. 

Case 1: 
R faces north. 

Case 2: 
R faces south. 

Reference: 
B is 2nd to the left of Q. 

Neighbours of R face the south. 

B and Q face in opposite direction. 

Inference: 
We can use the above information in both of the cases accordingly as shown in the figures: 

Reference: 
More than 2 people’s sits between B and S. 
D is 2nd to the left of S. 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Inference: 
After studying the first information we can say that either 3 or 4 persons are sitting between B and S. and with 
the second hint we can place D according to S in the row and we can say that there are exactly 4 persons are 
sitting between B and S. 

Reference: 
Neighbours of P face the same direction. 

A and P faces in opposite direction. 

C is 2nd to the right of A. 

Inference: 
With the first hint we can say that our case 2 is an invalid case as we cannot place P with both of its neighbour 
facing the same direction. 

And after placing P in case 1 we can fix the position of A and C easily and can complete the puzzle. 

21.    Following the final solution we can say that only 1 person sits to left of P. 

Hence, the correct answer is option A 

22. 

Following the final solution we can say that D is third to the right of B. 

Hence, the correct answer is option C. 

23. 

Following the final solution we can say that P and R are the neighbours of D. 

Hence, the correct answer is option D. 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
24.    Following the final solution we can say that S sits at the extreme left of the row 

Hence, the correct answer is option B. 

25. 

Following the final solution we can say that 3 persons sits between D and A. 

Hence, the correct answer is option C.

Common explanation: (Q. 26 to Q. 30) 

References: 
 D sits third from the extreme right end of the row. 

C sits to the immediate left of D 

Only six people sit between A and C. 

The person A sits fourth to the right of B. 

Inferences: 
 From above statements, 

We don’t know the number of seats in a linear row. So we will solve based on the above hints. 

Let the seat at extreme right end be 1 and its immediate left is 2 and so on in increasing order till left end. 

D sits 3rd seat from right end (reference point-1) 

C sits at 4th seat i.e. immediate left of D (reference point-2) 

The person A sits at 11 seat i.e. six people sit between A and C (reference point-3) 

B sits at 15th seat i.e. A sits fourth to the right of B (reference point-4) 

By using above information we get the following seating as shown below,

Inferences: 
 From above statements, 

If we observe the seating there are 11 seats in between B and C. 

As per 1st reference point, E sits in the middle of B and D. Therefore E sits at 9th seat i.e. 5 people sit to the 
right of E and 5 people sit to the left of E. 

Given, only ten persons sit to the left of E. Therefore we conclude that there are 19 seats in the linear row. 

Finally, F sits at 17th seat i.e. F sits 8th to the left of E (reference point-3) 

All conditions get satisfied and we get the completed seating [19 seats] as shown below,

26.    Following the common explanations, we get "19 seats are there in the linear row". 

Hence, option D is correct. 

27. 

Following the common explanations, we get "C sits 5th to the right of E". 

Hence, option D is correct. 

28. 

Following the final arrangement, it's clear that there is only one seat between A and E.  

Option B is hence the correct answer. 

29.    Following the final arrangement, it's clear that only C sits on even numbered seat. 

Remaining people sits on odd numbered seat.  

Option E is hence the correct answer. 

30. 

Following the final arrangement, it's clear that there are Four seat to the left of B. 

Option C is hence the correct answer. 

 
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Common Explanations (31-35): 

References: 
Kusum sits third to the right of Nonu. 
Kumar sits on the immediate right of Kusum. 
Kusum faces outward. 
Only one person sits between Sonu and Nonu. 
Ela is not an immediate neighbour of Nonu. 

References: 
Nupur sits second to the left of Ela.  
The immediate neighbours of Nupur face opposite direction. 

We thus get two possible positions of Nupur with his/her neighbours as shown in Case I and Case II 
respectively. 

References: 
Vicky sits third to the right of Vikas. Vicky is not an immediate neighbour of either Ela or Sonu. 
Kumar and Vicky face the direction same as that of Vikas. 

Now the only two positions where we can place Vicky and Vikas is shown in Case I. In Case II, if we place Vikas 
to the left of Nupur with opposite direction to the second neighbour of Nupur, the condition 'Vicky sits third to 
the right of Vikas' doesn't get fulfilled. Case II thus gets eliminated. 

Using the other pieces of information, we get the final chart as follows: 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
31.    Observing the final seating arrangement we can say that in Option E Nonu and Vikas are facing in 

opposite direction, while in all other options first person facing the same direction in which second 
person facing. 

Hence, the correct answer is option E. 

32.  Observing the final seating arrangement, we can say that Vicky and Kumar are sitting exactly between 

Kusum and Nonu when counted from the right of Kusum. 

Hence, option D is correct. 

33.  Observing the final seating arragement we can say that Nupur is sitting third to the left of Vikas. 

Option D is hence the correct answer. 

34.    Observing the final seating arrangement, we can say that the immediate neighbours of Ela are Vikas 

and Sonu. 

Option D is hence the correct answer. 

35.  Observing the final seating arrangement we can say that Kumar is sitting fourth to right of Sonu. 

Option B is hence the correct answer.

Common Explanations (36-40): 

Reference: 

  U is sitting third to the left of X. 
  X  likes Amish Tripathi and is sitting third to the right of the one who likes Chetan Bhagat. 
  S who likes Jhumpa Lahiri is sitting exactly between X and Z. 

Inference: 
Following two cases are possible with the above mentioned hints. 

Reference: 

  The one who likes Amitav Ghosh is sitting second to the right of the one who likes Jhumpa Lahiri. 
  T is sitting fourth to the right of Z. 
  Neither T nor Z is an immediate neighbour of W. 
  The one who likes Chetan Bhagat is to the immediate right of W and W does not like Arvind Adiga. 
  The one who likes V.S. Naipaul is sitting second to the left of W. 

Inference: 
The above hints can easily be placed in both the cases in the following manner. 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
Reference: 

  The one who likes Ruskin Bond is sitting second to the left of the one who likes Amish Tripathi. 
  W is sitting third to the left of Y. 

Inference: 
In accordance with the last hint we can say that Case 1 fails, as here W is third to the right of Y which violates 
the last hint. 

Thus by fixing the position of V at the vacant place, we get the final arrangement through Case 2. 

36.    From the following explanation it is clear that the one who likes Jhumpa Lahiri is third to the left of the 

one who likes Ruskin Bond. 

Hence option B is correct. 

37. 

From the following explanation it is clear that W likes Arundhati Roy. 

Hence option D is correct. 

38. 

From the following explanation it is clear that five persons sit between U and the one who likes Amitav 
Ghosh when counted from the left of latter. 

Hence option E is correct. 

39.    From the following explanation it is clear that 'V' is related to Arvind Adiga(liked by the person sitting 
opposite to V) in the same way as X is related to Arundhati Roy (liked by the person sitting opposite to 
X) and S is related to Chetan Bhagat. 

Hence option A is correct. 

40. 

From the following explanation it is clear that "T – Arvind Adiga" is wrongly matched. 

Hence option C is correct.

Reference: 

D is immediate neighbour of B.  
G is as much younger than D as he is older than H.  
None of G, H, and D are sitting immediate to one another.  

Inference: 

Given ages are - 7, 10, 13, 18, 28, 30, 36, and 42  
To satisfy the second hint now we'll check the possible combinations. 
We have one such combination where age difference is equal throughout. 7, 10 and 13 (difference is 3)  
Thus the ages of G, D and H are 10, 13 and 7 respectively.

A 

Inference: 
The only possible place for F is to the immediate left of B. Then his age will be 18 years. 
The vacant place is filled by the only left person i.e. E. 
Thus as per the first hint age of E is 28 years. 
As A is not the oldest, that means his age is not 42 years and the remaining ages are - 42 and 30. 
So, ages of A and C are 30 and 42 respectively. 
Thus the final arrangement is as follows. 

Case1: When G is third to the left of B

41.    From the following explanation it is clear that D is the only one whose age is an odd number, thus is 

the odd one out. 

Hence option D is correct. 

42. 

From the following explanation it is clear that the person whose age is 28 years is second to the left of 
the one who is the oldest person. 

Hence option A is correct.

From the following explanation it is clear that H and A are sitting at the extreme ends. 

Hence option E is correct. 

44.    From the following explanation it is clear that the difference of the ages of C and D is 29. 

Hence option B is correct. 

45. 

From the following explanation it is clear that "T – Arvind Adiga" is wrongly matched. 

Hence option C is correct.

Common Explanations (46-50): 

References  

     1.   The vessel F was third to the right of Black colored vessel. 
   2.  The Green vessel had 4 liters of Milk and it was at either of the extreme ends. 
   3.  Total  volume  of  Milk  in  the  vessel  F  and  the  volume  of  Milk  to  its  immediate  right  were  equal  to  the 

volume of Milk in the vessel A. 

   4.  The vessel D was placed exactly between the Red colored vessel and the vessel A. 
   5.  The vessel D had 3 liters of Milk. 
   6.  The vessel D and the vessel E were at a gap of two vessels. 
   7.  The vessel C was second to the left of the vessel having 6 liters of Milk 

Inferences 
 From above statements, 
     ●   The Milk in vessels A, B, C, D, E and F are 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6 liters but not necessarily in the same order. 
   ●  If Black colored vessel is placed at extreme left end, then Green colored vessel placed at extreme right 

end (Case-1). 

   ●  If Black colored vessel is placed at 2nd from left end, then Green colored vessel can be placed at either of 

the ends (we get two cases-2 & 3) 

   ●  If Black colored vessel is placed at 2nd from left end, then Green colored vessel can be placed at either of 
the  ends,  but  the  vessel  F  comes  at  extreme  right  end,  by  this  it  violates  point-3.  Hence  this  is  not 
possible. 

   ●  Now, the vessel D has 3 liters Milk and placed exactly between the Red colored vessel and the vessel A. 

From this, it is clearly observe that the vessel D is not placed at either of the ends. 

   ●  With reference to 4th, 5th, 6th & 7th point, the vessel D can be placed in each case. 

In Case-1 :- the vessel D is placed 2nd from right end, then the vessel F becomes Red colored and the vessel A 
becomes Green colored. The vessel C is placed at extreme left end and the vessel E is placed at 2nd from left 
end, by this 4th, 5th, 6th & 7th point get satisfied (only possibility)

In Case-2 :- the vessel D is placed 3rd from left end, then the vessel C becomes Red colored and the vessel A 
becomes Black colored. The vessel C is placed at 3rd from right end and the vessel E is placed at from right end, 
by this the immediate right of vessel F has vessel E with 6 liters. If we observe the 3rd reference point, it is not 
possible since the maximum liters in any vessel are 6 liters. So this case can be eliminated.

In Case-3 & 3-A :- the vessel D can be placed at either at 3rd or 4th from left end. But neither of the cases, the 
reference point-7 gets satisfied. Hence we eliminated the following cases.

     1.  Total  volume  of  Milk  in  the  vessel  F  and  the  volume  of  Milk  to  its  immediate  right  were  equal  to  the 

volume of Milk in the vessel A. 

   2. The Purple colored vessel had the thrice the volume of Milk as in the Vessel E. 
   3. The Blue vessel had more volume of Milk then vessel E. 

 Inferences 
 From above statements, 

     ●  Note: Only case-1 is left to continue the arrangements. 
   ● With respect to the 1st point, the vessel F has 1 liter milk; by this its immediate right vessel D has 3 liters 
milk. [Given condition, Vessel F + Vessel D = Vessel A, we know Vessel A has 4 liters milk i.e. 3 + 1 = 4 liters 
milk. Thus the given condition satisfied. 

   ● From table, vessel B has 6 liters milk. 
   ● Remaining liters available are 2 and 5. 
   ● With reference to 2nd point, the vessel E should have 2 liters milk, by this the vessel B becomes Purple 

colored (2*3 =6, i.e. thrice the volume of Milk as in the Vessel E) 

   ● Finally, the vessel C has 5 liters milk. 
   ● With reference to 3rd point, the vessel D is Blue colored (Vessel D, 3 > Vessel E, 2) 
   ● Finally,  Vessel  E  becomes  Yellow  colored  vessel.  Thus  we  get  the  completed  arrangement  as  shown  in 

table.

46.    The following common explanation, we get "B - P Purple clored - 6 liters". 

Hence, option D is correct. 

47. 

The following common explanation, we get "[Vessel C] [B-Purple colored-6 liters and its 2nd left is 
Vessel C]". 

Hence, option B is correct. 

48. 

The following common explanation, we get "Vessel C-Black colored-5 liters". 

Hence, option C is correct. 

49.    The following common explanation, we get "Two vessels". 

Hence, option D is correct. 

50. 

The following common explanation, we get "7 liters". 

E-Yellow - 2 liters & C - Black - 5 liters. Sum = 2 + 5 = 7 liters. 

Hence, option A is correct.

Common explanation : (Q. 51 to Q.55) 

References: 
Rahman and Sadyant sit opposite to each other. 

Charan sits second to the left of Rahman. 

Charan likes Maroon color. 

The person who likes Maroon sits second to the left of Sadyant. 

The person who likes White sits immediate to the right of Sadyant. 

The person who likes White and Blue sits opposite to each other and they do not face each other. 

The person who likes Blue faces outside the circle. 

Inferences: 
From the above mentioned hints two cases are possible here: 

Case 1: When Rahman faces outside and  
Sadyant faces inside 

Case 2: When Rahman faces inside and  
Sadyant faces outside 

References: 
Not more than two persons face the same direction sit together. 

Ojasya and Charan face the same direction. 

Rahman and Ojasya are immediate neighbors. 

Rahman and Sadyant sit opposite to each other and neither of them likes Cyan. 

Inferences: 
Keeping the very first hint in mind we can determine the directions of some persons in the circular 
arrangement. 
Here one more case arise from Case 2, which is named as Case 2A. 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
   
 
   
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Case 1: 
 When Sadyant, Ojasya and Charan 
face inside and Rahman faces 
outside 

Case 2: 
 When Sadyant, Charan and Ojasya  
face outside and  
Rahman faces inside 

Case 2(A): 
When directions of Charan and 
Ojasya can't be defined 

Here we will make a mental note that neither Rahman nor Sadyant likes Cyan. 

References: 
Idenya sits second to the right of Madhav who is a neighbor of the one who likes Cyan. 

Ekansh sits second to the right of Idenya. 

The immediate neighbors of Madhav face same direction. 

The person who likes Black sits second to the right of Ekansh. 

Inferences: 
Case 2 gets eliminated because there is no place for Ekansh to sit. 

Thus we are left with Case 1 and Case 2A only. 

Case 1: 

Case 2: No place for Ekansh 
to sit 
[Eliminated] 

Case 2(A): Satisfies all hints 

 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
References: 
The one who likes Indigo and Green are immediate neighbors. 

Rahman do not like Brown. 

Ojasya and Charan face the same direction.       

The one who likes Maroon sits third to the right of person who likes Green. 

Inferences: 
Here Case1 gets eliminated as there is no place to accommodate green color. 

Thus we are left with case 2A only. 

Thus, by filling the empty places we get the arrangement as follows.

51.    Following the common explanation, we get "Tanaya". 

Madhav’s third left is Rahman. Rahman’s second right is Tanaya. 

Hence, Option B is correct. 

52. 

Following the common explanation, we get "The one who likes Brown". 

Hence, Option D is correct. 

53. 

Following the common explanation, we get "The one who likes White-Madhav faces centre". 

Remaining all persons faces outside the centre. 

Hence, Option C is correct. 

54.    Following the common explanation, we get "None". 

Hence, Option D is correct. 

55. 

Following the common explanation, we get "Sadyant". 

Hence, Option A is correct.

Common Explanations (56-60): 

Reference: 

  The one who paid Rs. 79 was neighbouring Tony. 
  Tony was seated at one of the extreme ends and paid a sum that was a square between 35 and 70, 

which was not the least amount to be paid. 

  Prince was 4th to the left of the one who paid Rs. 39 which is not the least paid amount. 
  Sohan paid Rs. 39 but was not sitting at the extreme end. 
  Wahid was seated third to the right of Prince and Prince was not an immediate neighbor of Tony. 

Inference: 
Following three cases are possible from the given hints. 

The possible amounts paid by Tony are- 36, 49 and 64.

Reference: 

  Sum  of  the  amount  paid  by  Prince  and  Qamar  was  Rs.  160,  where  the  amount  paid  by  Prince  is  a 

perfect square between 30 and 90 and the amount paid by Qamar is a prime number. 

  Nobody paid an amount more than Rs. 85. 

Inference: 
Here we know that nobody paid an amount more than Rs. 85 and given the amount paid by Prince is a perfect 
square. 

So, the possible amount paid by Prince in the given scenario is Rs. 81 
And amount paid by Qamar is 160 – 81 =79, which is a prime number and both the amounts are less than 85.

  Prince was 4th to the left of the one who paid Rs. 39 which is not the least paid amount. 
  Tony was seated at one of the extreme ends and paid a sum that was a square between 35 and 70, 

which was not the least amount to be paid. 

Inference: 

  Thus we are left with case 1 only and the vacant position is filled with the only left person i.e.  Umesh. 
  The possible amounts paid by Tony are- 36, 49 and 64. 
  And also neither 39 is the least amount nor the amount paid by Tony is the least one. Thus, Wahid paid 

the least amount. 

  Thus Tony didn’t pay Rs. 36. 
 

If Tony paid Rs. 49 then the amount paid by Wahid is 500 – (84+81+42+75+39+79+49) => 51, which is 
not the least. 
If Tony paid Rs. 64 then the amount paid by Wahid is 500 – (84+81+42+75+39+79+64) => 36, which is 
the least amount in the given scenario.

56.    From the following explanation it is clear that Wahid paid the least amount which is Rs. 36. 

Hence option B is correct. 

57. 

From the following explanation it is clear that the difference between the amounts paid by the persons 
at extreme ends is 84 – 64 = 20. 

Hence option D is correct. 

58. 

From the following explanation it is clear that Tony paid Rs. 64. 

Hence option A is correct. 

59.    From the following explanation it is clear that "Qamar" is the odd one out because the amount paid by 

him is a prime number whereas the amount paid by all others are composite numbers. 

Hence option E is correct. 

60.    From the following explanation it is clear that "Wahid – 26" is the incorrect combination. 

Hence option C is correct.

Manoj likes Blue and sits at the extreme end. 

Manoj does not face the person who likes Green colour. 

Manoj sits to the left of Pravin. 

Qasim likes Green colour and sits fourth to the left of Sairam. 

Sairam faces Lavanya, who likes Red colour. 

No person sits between Sairam and Tahir, who is facing Pravin. 

Pravin sits immediate left of vacant seat. 

Inferences: 
From above statements, 

Manoj likes Blue sits at the extreme end. Manoj does not face the person who likes Green colour.  Manoj sits 
to the left of Pravin. 

Manoj sits to the left of Pravin. Therefore Manoj sits extreme left end in Row-1. 

No person sits between Sairam and Tahir, who is facing Pravin. 

Here, we get one more possibility i.e. Sairam and Tahir are may be the immediate neighbors or one vacant is 
there between Sairam and Tahir. It is shown in following case, 

By using all other information we get the following case, 

Case 1: Manoj sits at the extreme left end of the Row-1 and likes Blue colour (only possibility). Sairam and

Common explanation : (Q. 66 to Q.70) 

Reference: 
Gaurav had thrice the number of chocolates as that with Dhanush, who was sitting to the immediate right of 
Bimal. 

The person opposite to Bimal had 7 chocolates. 

The number of chocolates that Erik had was a prime number. 

Bimal had twice the number of chocolates that Erik had. 

They have different amount of chocolates with them viz. 4, 7,12, 17, 18, 21, 34 and 36. 

Inference: 
From the given number of chocolates, prime numbers are 7 and 17 only. But twice of 7 is 14, which is not 
among the given numbers. Thus the number of chocolates with Erik is17. 

Then as per the fourth hint, number of choclates with Bimal would be 34 accordingly. 

Then for number of chocolates with Gaurav and Dhanush, as per our first hint there are only two 
combinations which are 4 – 12 and 7 – 21 among the given set of numbers. 

But since we know that the person having 7 chocolates sits opposite to Bimal and Dhanush sits to the 
immediate right of Bimal, thus Dhanush will be having 4 chocolates. 

So, the number of chocolates with Dhanush is 4 and Gaurav is 12.

Reference: 
Ajay was sitting opposite to the person having 21 chocolates. 

The difference of the number of chocolates that Ajay and Bimal had was two, where the number of chocolates 
with Ajay was a perfect square. 

Ajay and Bimal were seated at a gap of two. 

Inference: 
The number of chocolates with Bimal is 34, and the difference between Ajay and Bimal's chocolates is 2, thus 
number of chocolates with Ajay would be 36 (perfect square of 6).

Chander 
Dhanush 
Erik 
Feroz 
Gaurav 
Harish 

Reference: 
Harish was sitting third to the left of the one who had 18 chocolates. 

Harish and Gaurav were seated at a gap of 1 person. 

Erik and Feroz had consecutive number of chocolates.  

The number of chocolates with Gaurav was opposite of the digits of the number of chocolates with Harish. i.e. 
if Harish has 'mn' number of chocolates, then Gaurav will have 'nm' number of chocolates. 

Harish had more chocolates than Gaurav and the number of chocolates with both of them were in double 
digits. 

 
 
 
 
 
  
  
  
 
                 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Inference: 

We already know that Erik has 17 chocolates, so the number of chocolates with Feroz is 18 (refer third hint). 

Now the numbers left are - 7 and 21 and the persons left are Harish and Chander. 

With the fourth hint it is clear that number of chocolates with Harish is 21 (which is opposite to 12[Gaurav's 
chocolates] and more than Gaurav) 

So Chander will be having 7 chocolates and sits opposite to Bimal. 

Persons

66.    From the following explanation it is clear that Chander has the seocnd least number of chocolates. 

Hence option B is correct. 

67. 

From the following explanation it is clear that "Dhanush – 4" is the correct combination. 

Hence option C is correct. 

68. 

The person having least number of chocolates is Dhanush and the person second to his left is Harish 
having 21 chocolates. 

 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
  
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Ajay has 36 chocolates. 

Required difference = 36 – 21 -> 15. 

Thus, Ajay has 15 chocolates more than the one who sits second to the left of one who has the least 
number of chocolates. 

Hence option A is correct. 

69.    From the following explanation it is clear that the odd one out here is 'Harish' who has an odd number 

of chocolates. 

Rest of the persons have even number of chocolates. 

Hence option E is correct. 

70. 

From the following explanation it is clear that the one who has 18 chocolates is fifth to the right of the 
one who has 12 chocolates. 

Hence option D is correct.

Common Explanations (71-75): 

References: 
Seetha sits exactly in the middle of the north facing row. 

Pravin sits at the extreme right end of the south facing row. 

Tushar sits with Ximon and Wahab and opposite to Umesh. 

Wahab was born in August month. 

Inferences: 
From above statements 

Seetha sits exactly in the middle of the north facing row. 

Seetha sits exactly in the middle of the Row-1 and faces north direction. 

Pravin sits at the extreme right end of the south facing row. 

Pravin sits at the extreme right end of the Row-2 and faces south direction. 

Tushar sits with Ximon and Wahab and opposite to Umesh. Wahab was born in August month. 

Here we get two possibilities i.e. 

Case 1: Tushar is an immediate neighbor of both Ximon and Wahab. Tushar sits opposite to Umesh. Wahab 
was born in August month. Here there is no place for Tushar in the Row-1. If Tushar sits in the Row-2 i.e. 
2nd from the left end (only possibility) and then and then Wahab sits to the immediate right of Tushar & he 
was born in August month. Also, Ximon sits to the immediate left of Tushar. Finally, Umesh sits opposite to 
Tushar. 

Case 2: Tushar is an immediate neighbor of both Ximon and Wahab. Tushar sits opposite to Umesh. Wahab 
was born in August month. Here there is no place for Tushar in the Row-1. If Tushar sits in the Row-2 i.e. 
2nd from the left end (only possibility) and then and then Wahab sits to the immediate left of Tushar & he was 
born in August month. Also, Ximon sits to the immediate right of Tushar. Finally, Umesh sits opposite to 
Tushar. 

By using all above information, we get the initial seating as follows, 

Month [South]

References: 
Queen sits opposite to Raman and to the immediate right of the person, who was born in May month. Raman 
doesn’t face south direction. 

Only one person sits between the two persons who were born in May. 

Inferences: 
From above statements 

Queen sits opposite to Raman and to the immediate right of the person, who was born in May month. Raman 
doesn’t face south direction. 

Raman faces north direction and sits opposite to Queen. Queen faces south direction and sits to the 
immediate right of the person, who was born in May month. 

Case 1: With respect to above statement, there is no place for Queen in case-1. Thus case-1 becomes invalid 
and it can be eliminated. 

Case :1 [Eliminated] 
No place for Queen, who sits to the immediate right of the 
person, who was born in May month in Row-2 

Month [South] 
Person [Row-2]  Pravin 

August 
Wahab 

Tushar

Month [North] 

Seetha  Umesh 

Case  2:  Here,  Raman  sits  2nd from  the  left  end  of  the  Row-1  and  he  faces  Queen  (only  possibility).  As  per 
statement,  Ximon  was  born  in  May  month.  Queen  sits  to  the  immediate  right  of  Ximon.  Given,  only  one 
person sits between the two persons who were born in May. Therefore, Pravin was born in May month. 

All the statements gets satisfied and we get the following seating, 

Month [South]  May 
Person [Row-2]  Pravin  Queen 

May 
Ximon 

August 
Tushar  Wahab 

Case :2

Note: Case-1 gets eliminated and we have Case-2 to continue. 

References: 
The person who was born in March sits to the immediate right of Yousuf and opposite to the person who is 
born in April. 

Only one person sits between the two persons who were born in April. 

The person born in January sits to the right of the person born in July but they don’t sit at any of the ends. 

Exactly two persons were born in each of the month of April, May and June. 

Inferences: 
From above statements 

The person who was born in March sits to the immediate right of Yousuf and opposite to the person who is 
born in April. 

Here, Yousuf sits at extreme left end of the Row-1 (only possibility) and Raman was born in March & he sits to 
the immediate right of Yousuf. Raman faces Queen, who was born in April as per statement. 

Only one person sits between the two persons who were born in April. 

Here, both Queen and Tushar were born in April & only Ximon sits between Queen and Tushar. 

The person born in January sits to the right of the person born in July but they don’t sit at any of the ends. 

Finally, Vinoth sits at extreme right end of the Row-1 (only person left among ten). As per above statement, 
Seetha was born in July and Umesh was born in January i.e. they are sitting from 3rd and 2nd from the right end 
of the Row-1 respectively. 

Exactly two persons were born in each of the month of April, May and June. 

Finally, Yousuf and Vinoth were born in June month (only possibility). Thus we get the completed seating 
arrangement as shown below.

Common explanation : (Q. 76 to Q. 80) 

Reference: 
Some persons are sitting around a circular table facing towards the centre and at an equal distance from each 
other. Each of these persons has a different income greater than 11 Lakhs but less than 20 Lakhs. 

Inference: 
Here, we can say that there were at most 8 seats in the arrangement and we keep the rest of the information 
in mind while solving the puzzle. 

Reference: 
Anuj sits opposite to Faiz but neither of them are sitting adjacent to Jaya. 

Inference: 
Using the above information we can say that there were even numbers of seats around the circular table as it 
is  given  that  Anuj  is  sitting  opposite  to  Faiz  and  we  know  that  all  these  persons  are  equidistant  from  each 
other which cannot be possible if the number of seats is odd. 

Here,  we  will  make  a  mental  note  that  neither  Jaya  nor  Reet  are  sitting  adjacent  to  Jaya. 

Reference: 
There are two seats between Jaya and Reet. 

Inference: 
At this point we can say that were exactly 8 seats in the arrangement because of the number of seats is less 
than 8 the above hints will not follow. 

At this point we can fix the position of Jaya, Reet, Anuj and Faiz as: 

Case 1: 

Case 2: 

Reference: 

Anuj’s income is in multiple of 5 but it is not the highest. 

Reet’s income is in perfect square number. 

Jaya’s income is in even number. 

 
 
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
Inference: 

After using the above hints, we have: 

Anuj’ income = 15 Lakhs 

Reet’s income = 16 Lakhs 

Here, we will make mental note that income of Jaya was an even number. 

Reference: 

Pari sits on the seat which is second to the right of one, whose income is 13 Lakhs. 

The one, whose income is 19 Lakhs, is sitting on the seat which is to the immediate right of Pari’s seat. 

Inference: 

Here, there are three possible scenarios in which we can use the above hints in case 1. 

Case 1-A 

Case 1-B: 

Case 1-C: 

Case 2: 

Reference: 

Only one seat was vacant. 

None of the seats adjacent to Anuj is vacant. 

Inference: 

At this point our Case 1-A, Case 1-B and Case 2 are contradicting with the above hints. So we can say that Case 
1-A, Case 1-B and Case 2 are invalid cases. 

Reference: 

The income of the persons sitting adjacent to vacant seat is the just next number of income the persons sitting 
adjacent to them. 
The number of persons between Reet and Dev are same as the number of persons between Anuj and Mala. 

 
  
  
  
  
  
  
 
  
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
  
  
  
  
  
Inference: 
 After using the above hints, we have: 

Case 1-C:  

76.    Following the final solution we can say that seven persons are sitting around the circular table. 

Hence, the correct answer is option B. 

77. 

Following the final solution we can say that Reet is sitting opposite to Mala. 

Hence, the correct answer is option D. 

78. 

Following the final solution we can say that we have no information about the income  of Pari but we 
have only two option left with us that must be lie in between 11 Lakhs and 20 Lakhs i.e 12 Lakhs and 18 
Lakhs so we can say that Pari income must be either 12 Lakhs or 18 Lakhs. 

Hence, the correct answer is option D. 

79.    Following the final solution we can say that the vacant seat third to the right of Dev. 

Hence, the correct answer is option A. 

80. 

Following the final solution we can say that Jaya is the one that does not belong to the group because 
of all the persons given in the option Jaya is the only persons whose income is in even number. 

Hence, the correct answer is option C.

Common Explanations (81-85): 

Reference: 

  Rahul is sitting third to the left of Deepak. 
  Deepak likes  Zee TV and is sitting third to the right of the one who likes Sony. 
  The one who likes &tv is sitting second to the left of the one who likes Zee TV. 

Inference: 
On the basis of above direct hints, following arrangement can be drawn: 

 Reference: 

  The one who likes Sony is to the immediate right of Hiten and Hiten does not like Star plus. 
  The one who likes SAB is sitting second to the left of Hiten. 
  Hiten is sitting third to the left of Deepika. 

Inference: 

On the basis of above direct hints, following arrangement can be drawn: 

Reference: 

  Neither Sumeet nor Kunal is an immediate neighbour of Hiten. 
  Viraj who likes Colors is sitting exactly between Deepak and Kunal. 

Inference: 
With the first hint it is clear that neither Sumeet nor Kunal can sit adjacent to Hiten and Viraj sits exactly  
between Deepak and Kunal, So, Kunal must be sitting second to the right of Deepak and Viraj sits immediate 
right of Deepak. 

 
 
 
  
 
 
 
  
 
 
  
 
 
The only left place for Sumeet is thus, second to the left of Deepak. 

Reference:  

  The one who likes Star Bharat is sitting second to the right of the one who likes Colors. 

Inference: 
As Hiten does not like Star plus, so Deepika must like Star plus. 

Hiten must like the only left channel i.e. DD National. 

And the only left person i.e. Anup must  be sitting at immediate left of Hiten.

From the following explanation it is clear that the one who likes Star plus is third to the right of Hiten. 

Hence option A is correct. 

84.    From the following explanation it is clear that Anup is related to Sony in the same way as Viraj is 

related to Star Bharat and Hiten is related to &tv. 

Logic: The person is related to channel as second to the left of the channel. 

Hence option E is correct. 

85. 

From the following explanation it is clear that Anup-Star plus is the false combination. 

Hence option B is correct.

Common Explanations (86-90): 

Reference: 
Six  persons  –  Bala,  Siya,  Raja,  Vani, Pant and Minu  were  sitting  in  a  straight  facing towards  north,  and  each 
is  shown  below: 
person  had  a  different  age  and  the  order  of  the  ages  of  these  persons 

Vani (109) > Siya (95) > Minu (91) > Pant (118) > Bala (100) > Raja (86) 

The numbers shown in the bracket shows the marks obtained by these persons in the IQ test. Each person was 
born  in  different  city  –  Pune,  Agra,  Noida,  Ranchi,  Patna  and  Jhansi  not  necessarily  in  the  same  order. 

Inference: 
After using the above hints, we have: 

Eldest 

 Order of Age  Person  Marks 
109 
95 
91 
118 
86 
100 

Vani 
Siya 
Minu 
Pant 
Raja 
Bala 

Youngest 

We will keep the rest of the information in mind while solving the puzzle. 

Reference: 
The person with the highest marks was at one of the extreme end. 
Number of persons to the left of Siya was equal to the number of persons to the right of the one born in Agra. 
Siya was 3rd to the left of the one born in Pune. 

Inference: 
We already know that Pant scored highest marks. 
Here, we have three possible scenarios in which the above hints can be used accordingly. 

Case 1: 

Case 2: 

Case 3: 

 
  
  
  
  
 
 
  
  
 
 
 
 
 
Reference: 
Siya was to the immediate left of Minu. 
The eldest person was 3rd to the right of the one born in Jhansi. 
Vani was born in Ranchi. 

Inference: 
We already know that Vani is the eldest person. 
Here, we have three possible scenarios in which the above hints can be used accordingly. 

Case 1: 

Case 2: 

Case 3: 

Reference: 
The one born in Patna was to the immediate left of the person with the lowest marks. 

Siya was not neighbouring the person with the lowest marks. 

Inference: 
 We already know that Raja scored the lowest marks. 

At this point we cannot fix the position of Raja in case 1 and case 3 according to the given hints so we can say 
that case 1 and case 3 are invalid cases. 

Case 2: 

At this point we can say that Siya was born in Noida and Bala was born in Patna. 

Case 2: 

 
  
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
  
 
  
 
 
86.    Following the final solution we can say that the one who scored third highest marks was born in Patna. 

Hence, the correct answer is option D. 

87. 

Following  the  final  solution  we  can  say  that  two  persons  scored  more  marks  than  the  one  who  was 
born in Patna. 

Hence, the correct answer is option B. 

88. 

Following the final solution we can say that Siya was sitting at an extreme end. 

Hence, the correct answer is option E. 

89.    Following the final solution we can say that the marks scored by the persons who were born in Noida 

and Patna were 95 and 100 respectively. 

Required Difference = 100 – 95 = 5 

Hence, the correct answer is option A. 

90. 

Following the final solution we can say that two persons were there between Bala and the one who 
was born in Agra. 

Hence, the correct answer is option C.

Common Explanations (91-95): 

Reference: 
Nine cars – Nano, Creta, Verna, Polo, Brezza, Duster, WagonR, Captur and Amaze, were parked in a circular 
parking  lot  which  has  space  to  park  at  least  10  cars.  All  the  cars  were  parked  facing  towards  the  centre. 

Inference: 
We will keep this information in mind while solving the puzzle. 

Reference: 
Polo was parked second to the left of Captur and was at a gap of 3 spots from Duster. 
Amaze was parked on the immediate right of Duster. 
WagonR and Polo were parked at a gap of 5 spots and only one car was parked on one of those 5 spots. 

Inference: 
Here, we have two possible scenarios in which above hints can be used accordingly. 

Case 1: 

Case 2: 

Here, we cannot fix the position of WagonR on the sixth to the right of Polo in case 1 and sixth to the left of 
polo in case 2 as this will contradict the hints that only one car was parked between WagonR and Polo. 
Reference: 
Brezza was parked neighbouring Nano and was second to the left of WagonR. 
Verna was parked at a gap of 1 spot from Duster. 

Inference: 
At  this  point  we  cannot  fix  the  position  of  Brezza  second  to  the  left  of  WagonR  in  case  2  because  this  will 
contradict with the information that only one car was parked between WagonR and Polo. 

After using the above hints in case 1, we have: 

 
  
  
  
  
  
 
 
 
 
 
  
  
  
 
Case 1-A: 

Case 1-B: 

Reference: 
Only 2 cars were parked between Nano and Duster, but Nano was not parked neighbouring Verna. 
Not more than 2 spots were there between Brezza and Verna when counted from the right of Verna. 

Inference: 
At this point we cannot use the above hints in case 1-B as this is contradicting with the hints that only 2 cars 
were parked between Nano and Duster so we can say that case 1-B is an invalid case. 

Case 1-A: 

Reference: 
Number  of  spots  between  Creta  and  Brezza  when  counted  from  the  left  of  Creta  was  one  more  than  the 
number of spots between Brezza and Amaze when counted from the right of Amaze. 

Inference: 
After using the above hints we can fix the position of Creta easily. 

 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
  
  
  
 
 
Case 1-A: 

91.    Following the final solution, we can say that Creta was third to the left of Polo. 

Hence, the correct answer is option C. 

92. 

Following the final solution, we can say that there were 2 vacant spots between WagonR and Duster, 
when counted from the left of WagonR. 

Hence, the correct answer is option A. 

93. 

Following the final solution, we can say that Captur was sixth to the left of Nano. 

Hence, the correct answer is option A. 

94.    Following the final solution, we can say that three cars were parked between Creta and Verna, when 

counted from the right of Verna. 

Hence, the correct answer is option C. 

95.    Following the final solution, we can say that 17 cars can be parked in the parking lot. 

Hence, the correct answer is option D.

Common Explanations (96-100): 

Reference: 
B is third to the left of C, who faces (i) ______. 
Only D is adjacent to C. 
B is on the immediate right of G, who faces north. 

Inference: 
With the second hint is clear that C is at an extreme end, only then it is possible for C to have only one 
immediate neighbor i.e. D. 

But we don’t know whether C is at extreme right end or extreme left end, so we can have two possible cases. 

Case-1: When C is at extreme right end and faces north 

Case-2: When C is at extreme left end and faces south. 

Reference: 
F is second to the right of B, who faces (iii) ________. 
Not more than two persons facing same direction are adjacent to each other. 

Inference: 
We can have different implications of the first hint in both the cases. 

In Case-1: B must face South in order to place F second to its right. 

In Case-2: B must face North in order to place F second to its right. 
As per the second hint, the immediate neighbors of B and G must face south direction. 

 
  
 
 
 
  
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
  
 
Reference: 
(ii) _____ is second to the left of G and faces north. 
A and E are immediate neighbors, where the latter is at an extreme end. 

Inference: 
Case-2 gets eliminated due to non-fulfillment of the first hint, because the person sitting second to the left of 
G does not face north direction. 

Thus, we will proceed with case-1 only. We don’t know the person sitting second to the left of G, but we 
definitely know that he/she faces north direction. 

A and E are immediate neighbors with E being positioned at extreme end, thus A must be adjacent to F and E 
is at extreme left end. 

Reference: 
H is on the immediate right of (iv) ______ 
Not more than two persons facing same direction are adjacent to each other. 

Inference: 
The only place left for H, is immediate left of B. Thus D faces south, only then H will be on immediate right of 
D. 

As per the second hint, H must face north direction and F must face south direction. 

Reference: 
The immediate neighbors of A face (v) ______ direction. 
In a linear row of 8 persons from A to H, four people face towards north and four towards south. 

Inference: 
As four persons face south direction, thus E must face south direction. 
Therefore the immediate neighbors of A face south direction. 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
96.    Following the final solution, we get 

A will fill the blank (ii). 

Hence option B is correct. 

97. 

Following the final solution, we get 

D will fill the blank (iv). 

Hence option D is correct. 

98. 

Following the final solution, we get 

North will fill the blank (i). 

Hence option C is correct. 

99.    Following the final solution, we get 

‘The direction same as faced by D’ will fill the blank (iii). 

Hence option B is correct. 

100.  Following the final solution, we get 

South will fill the blank (v). 

Hence option A is correct.
