BLOOD  RELATIONSHIP

Problems of this type involves analysis
of certain blood relations and then interpreting
certain relations on the basis of the given infor-
mations.  In solving such questions the candi-
date must be familier with blood relations in a
family.  The  following  chart  would  prove  im-
mensely beneficial to the candidates for solving
such questions:

Mother's or Father's son:Brother.

Mother's or Father's daughter : Sister

Mother's or Father's brother : Uncle

Mother's of Father's sister : Aunt

Mother's or Father's mother : Grandmother

Mother's or Father's Father : Grand father.

Son's Wife : Daughter-in-law

Daughter's husband : Son-in-law.

Husband's or Wife's brother : Brother -in-law

Husband's or Wife's sister : Sister-in-law.

Brother's or Sister's Son : Nephew

Brother's or sister's Daughter : Niece.

Uncle or aunts son or daughter : Cousin.

Sister's husband : Brother-in-law

Brother's wife : Sister-in-law

Grand father's  only son : Father

Grand mother's only son : Father

Grand father's  son : Father or Uncle.

Grand mother's Son : Father or Uncle.

Grand father's only daughter-in-law : Mother

Grand mother's only  daughter-in-law : Mother

Great Nephew and Niece : The grandson and
granddaughter respectively of one's own or one's
spoure's   (partner) brother or sister.

Aunt  :  Grandparent's  sister  or  grandparent's
brother's wife.

Uncle : Grandparent's brother or grandparent's
sister's husband.

Some simple questions are given below.

E.g.1 : Pointing to a person, a man said
to a women, 'His mother is the only daughter of
your father'', How was the women related to the
person?

(1)Aunt
(4) Daughter  (5) None of these.

(2)Mother   (3) Wife

Method :

Such questions can be easily solved by
adopting a method of 'backtracking', ie, starting
from the last information and proceed backward.
For example, if it is given that he is the son of
the mother of my grandfather's daughter.

Solution to E.g.1:

Only  Daughter  of   women's  f ather

ïƒž women itself

The persons mother is the woman itself
Hence, the women is the person's mother So,
answer is (2).

E.G.2 : Directions (Qs.1-3) : Read the following
information carefully and answer the questions
that follow:

In a family, there are six members A, B,
C, D, E, and F. A and B are a married couple, A
being the male member. D is the only  son of C,
who is the brother of A. E is the sister of D. B is
the daughter-in-law of F, whose husband has
died.

1. How is F related to A?

1) Mother

(3) Sister

(2) Sister-in-law

(4) Mother-in-law

(5) None of these

2. How is E related to C?

(1) Sister

(3) Cousin

(2) Daughter

(4) Mother

(5) None of these

3. Who is C to B ?

(1) Brother
(3) Son-n-law
(5) None of these

(2)  Brother-in-law
(4) Nephew

Suggested Method for questions like E.g. 2:

In questions of this type, what is required
is to establish the relationships among the mem-
bers of a whole family and not between two per-
sons as in E.g. 1. such question can be easily
solved by drawing a family tree dragram.

Drawing a family tree.

(a) Vertical or diagonal lines should be used

to represent parent-child relationships.

(b) A double horizontal line ( like )  should be

used to represent marriages.

(c)

a dashed line should be used to repre-
sent brother or sister relationships.

(d) Put a + sign before someone who is a
male and a - sign before some one who
is a female.

(e) Whenever something is not known put a?
mark or some symber (x, y, z, @, $ ......)

For example, consider the following diagram

+A-------B(-)  <==> D (+)

F (?)

+(E)--------G(-)<==>C(+)

(iv) C and G are a couple, C is the husband
and G is the wife. They have one child H
whose sex is not known

Paints to be Noted :

(i)

(ii)

It is advisable to being with a sentence
that gives information about parent-child
relationship. Grandfather-grandmother re-
lationships and brother-sister relatioships
should be touched later.

Try your best that you do not draw a new
diagram for every new information that you
read. Instead, try to 'add' to the existing
diagram on reading a new information.

Solution to E.g.2:

We start with the 3rd sentence, since it
given a parent-child relationship. The diagram
is:

A (?)--------------C(+)

[D is the only son of
C    who    is    the
brother  of  A]

D (+)

Now, we should look for a sentence that
given information about  A or C or D, The sec-
ond sentence is appropriate. Incorporating it into
the diagram, we have

B(-)<===>A(+)------C(+)

[Aand B are married
couple, A being the
male  member.]

The above diagram tells as that

Now, we incorporate the fourth sentence:

H (?)

D (+)

(i) B and D are a couple, D is the husband

while B is the wife.

(ii) B has a brother  A.
(iii)

The couple, B and D have three children
F, E and G. (Note : Apart from vertical or
diagonal lines, son or daughter are also
easily established if two persons are con-
nected be dashed lines. Also Note that
E is the brother of F even though there is
no dashed line, but they have the same
root.) Of three children E is male, G is
female, but the sex of  F is not known.

B(-)<==> A(+)----C(+)

[E is the sister of D]

        D(+)            E (-)

Finally, we incorporate the last sentence. Note
that F must be a female because her husband
has died. [One who has/had a husband must
be a female.]

      F(-)

Solution to E.g.3:

[ B is the daughter-
in-law  of  F,  whose
husband has died]

The sentence (e) is based on parent-child rela-
tionship. Hence, begin with (e)

B(-)<==>A(+)--------C(-)

B(-,?)

     D(+)

          E(-)

     1.(1) 2. (2) 3. (2)

E.g.3 : Directions : Read the following informa-
tion carefully and answer the questions given
below it:

(a)

There is a group of six persons A, B, C,
D, E  and F in a family, They are Psy-
chologist,  Manager,  Lawyer,  Jeweller,
Doctor and Engineer.

(b)

The doctor is the grandfather of F who is
a psychologist

 c)

The manager D  is  married  to  A.

d) C, the Jeweller  is married to the lawyer.

e) B is the mother of F and E.

f)

There  are  two  married  couples  in  the
family.

1. What is the profession of E ?

(1) Doctor
(4) Psychologist  (5) None of these.

(2) Jeweller  (3) Manager

2. How is A related to E ?

(1) Brother
(2) Uncle (3) Father
(4) Grandfather  (5) None of these.

3. How many male members are there in

the family ?

(1) One  (2)  Three  (3) Four  (4) Two
(5) Can't be determined.

SUGGESTED METHOD :

Same as that for  solving problems on
blood relations (ie, of the type E.g.2 ). While
making the family tree, the professions of each
individual should be incorporated below their
names in addition to their sex. For example,

A means a is male and an Engineer. (+, Eng)

[B is the mother of F
and E ]

   F(?, ?)      E (?, ?)

(b)

given the information that F is a psycholo-
gist. Note that if the doctor is the grand-
father of F and if B is the mother of F.
Then B must  be the daughter-in-law of
the doctor. The diagram becomes.

? (+, Doc)

     ?<==>B(-, ? )

F(? Psy)

E (? ?)

From (c), D(?,Man)

<==>A (? ?)

From (d), C (?, Jew ) <==> ?  (?, Law)

Hence B must be the lawyer. Hence we have;

A(+,Doc) <==> D(-,Man)

   C(_,Jew) <==> B (-,Law)

F (?, Psy )

E (?, Eng)

Hence the answers are :-

1. (5)

2. (4)

3. (5)

E.g.4:- (i) 'A*B' means 'A is sister of B'

(ii) 'A0B' means 'B is mother of A'

(iii) 'A+B' means 'A is brother of B'

(iv) 'A=B' means 'B is father of A'.

Which of the following means 'M is maternal

uncle  of N'?

1) M+P+Q*N   2) N+P=Q*M  3) NOP*M+Q

4) N*POQ*M  5) None of these

Solution :-

Maternal uncle' = Mother's brother. So 0
(mother) and '+' (brother) signs must be used.
The only  one choice of in which both the signs
are used is N0P*M+Q.

N0P*M+Q

 ==> P is the mother of N, P is the sister of  M

is the brother of Q

==> P is the mother of N, M is the brother of

p.

<==> M is the maternal uncle of N.

So the answer is (3).

Answers

1. (3); Kedar's mother's brother Kedar's uncle.

Father of Veena's  son Nithin

                               Veena's Husband.

Hence, Kedar's Uncle is Veen's husband.

Kedar is Veena's Nephew.

2. (2) Lady's father's son's mother

Lady's mother

Lady's mother's daughter

Lady or lady's sister.

Hence, person in the photograph is the
brother of the lady.

3(1) Shanti's brother's uncle's son

Shanti's cousin

Hence,  the  lady  in  the  photograph  is
shati's aunt.

4(1) Radhika's daughter's brother's mother

Radhika herself.

Man's sister is Radhika herself

Man is the brother of Radhika.

5(1) Women mother's husband

Women's father

Only son-in-law of women's father

Women's husband

Women's husband's brother-in-law

Women's brother.

6 (3)

7 (2)

8 (4)

9 (1)

10 (3);Man's grandfather's daughter-in-law

Man's mother or aunt.

Son of man's mother or aunt

Man himself or man's cousin

Hence, the lady is man's sister-in-law or
man's cousins sister-in-law (Many or may
not be man's wife).

But, since there is such a choice (3), it
must be the answer.

(Questions 11-13 ):

11 (5) K is N's brothers sister's mother

k is N's mother.

12 (3) K is P's mother's brother's father's sister

K is P's mother's father's sister.

K is P's mother's aunt

K is P's grant-aunt

ie, X*D*Y

13 (4)

14 (1)

Questions (15-17)

15 (2) PxQ-S means P is the son of Q who is

the wife of S

ie, P is the son of S or S is the father of
P.

16 (3) T-SxB-M means T is the wife of S who is
the son of B who is the wife of M

ie, T is the wife of the son of M (father)

ie, T is the daughter-in-law of M

But as this is not given in the choice, so
the fact in (3) derived from SxB is true.

 17 (2)ZxT-SxU means Z is the son of T who is
the wife of S who is the son of U. ie, Z is
the son of S who is the son of U.

ie, Z is the grandson or U is the grand-
mother  (since,U+P=U  daughter  of  P)
From the choice (2) is true.

Questions 18-19)

18. (5) Out of the choices look for the choice in
which the signs '/' and 'x', ie, 'wife of' and
husband of' are not there between P and
Q. Since  the inclusion  of these  do not
make it a blood relationship in this case,
since there are no signs for brother-in-
law, sister-in-law etc. Hence the answer
is (5)

19.(4)  Grandmother,  ie,  mother's  mother  or

father's mother

Hence there are four possibilities,
P can be Q's mother's mother
P can be Q's mother's father's wife.
P can be Q's father's mother.
P can be Q's father's father's wife.
Hence  the  answer  is  P/R+S-T+QxU
Since, there is no sign for mother, and
father's sign comes twice.

20(2); Boys  maternal  uncle  willbe  brother  of
boy's mother. Maternal uncle of mother's
brother and maternals uncle of lady are
brothers means lady is sister to mother's
brother ie, lady is the mother of the boy.
So the boy is women's son.

21. (5); K is the brother of N and X. So, Y who is
the mother of N, and Z, who is the father

of K, will be the mother and father of all
the three. However, it is not mentioned
whether N is a male or female. So, the
statements cannot be definitely true.

22.(1);Grandmother is one female, mother is
another, wives of four sons are the four
females and two daughters of all four sons
are  eight  females.  So,  in  all  there  are
1+1+4+8=14 females.

Questions (23-27)

Let us sort out the data (leaving aside
the I.Q.part for the being) in a systematic
way:

I. We  note that  there  are three  females.
Now, C is female, G is female while B,F
E and D are all males. It implies that the
third female is A.

II. Now, since G is the most intelligent and
since none of the married topped the I.Q.
test,  it  implies  that  G  is  unmarried.  It
means  that  both  A  and  C  are  married
because there are two married couples
(hence two married females.)

III.

The grandmother of G has two sons. So
the grandmother cannot be C because C
has 'one  son and one daughter'  too. It
implies that A is the grandmother.

IV Since F is a grandfather and Since A is
grandmother and since none in the fam-
ily is a widow or a widower, A and F must
be a couple. On the same logic, since B
is a father and since C is a mother, B and
C must be a couple.

V.

The son of C is E, who is the grandson of
F. The granddaughter is G, whose grand-
mother A has two sons: one, her own fa-
ther B and the other, D.

The family-tree  can be easily constructed
as shown below.

F(+)==A(-)

D(+)==B(+)==C(-)

E(+) G(-)

+means male

-means female.

Also let us pick the relevant information
regarding  the I.Q. test. These are:

(i) G is the most intelligent

(ii) B is more intelligent than his son.

(iii) C is more intelligent than her husband.

(iv)

The father of B is more intelligent than B.

(v) E is the least intelligent.

(vi)

(vii)

F is the second most intelligent.

The mother of b is less intelligent than B.

(viii) D is more intelligent than his brother but

less intelligent than his wife.

All these statements can lead to a defi-
nite order of intelligence as known:

G>F>C>D>B>A>E

Now, the question can easily be answered
as:

23 (1),  24 (4)  25  (1),  26 (1),  27( 4).

Question (28-32)

In the group of seven persons, there are
three females and four males (from state-
ments I and 3) Engineers is a male mem-
ber (statement3) Out of three females one
is a married teacher, and one is a house-
wife (statement 4 and 5). The husband of
teacher is the oldest member. The oldest
member is not the Doctor and the man-
ager. Hence Professor must be oldest and
the third female must be the chemist.

Hence,  the  three  females  are Teacher
(married),  Housewife  and  Chemist
(youngest).

The male members are Professor (old-
est).

Engineer, Manager and Doctor.
