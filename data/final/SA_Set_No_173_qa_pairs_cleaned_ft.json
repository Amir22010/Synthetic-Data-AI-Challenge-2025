The circular table creates specific geometric relationships where each person has exactly two neighbors. Step 2: A's requirement to sit next to both B and C, while B and C cannot be adjacent, creates an immediate geometric challenge that severely limits possible arrangements. Step 3: D must sit directly opposite A, which fixes D's position exactly across from A in the circle. Step 4: E must sit next to D, limiting E to exactly two possible positions adjacent to D. Step 5: Testing all possible arrangements reveals that certain pairs create irresolvable conflicts. Step 6: Through systematic elimination of invalid configurations, we determine which specific pair cannot coexist while satisfying all given constraints."
