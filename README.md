### Advanced Prompt Engineering

#### Question Generation Prompts - Detailed Implementation

Our question generation employs multi-layered prompt engineering with constraint verification:

**System-Level Quality Assurance:**
```python
qgen_system_prompt = """CRITICAL: You MUST generate questions with LOGICALLY SOUND, VERIFIABLE answers and explanations.

VERIFICATION REQUIREMENTS:
1. CORRECT ANSWER must be DEFINITELY TRUE based on question constraints
2. EXPLANATION must LOGICALLY prove why the answer is correct through systematic deduction
3. ALL DISTRACTORS must be PLAUSIBLE but CLEARLY WRONG when analyzed against constraints
4. Questions must have ONE IRREFUTABLE SOLUTION requiring analytical reasoning

DOMAIN EXPERTISE REQUIREMENTS:
- SEATING: Complex circular arrangements, geometric positioning, conditional adjacency
- BLOOD RELATIONS: Multi-generational families, kinship logic, inheritance patterns
- EXCLUDE: Counting/permutation problems, trivia, ambiguous questions

QUALITY STANDARDS:

- **ü•á Winner: Team [@rr @skyrocket223 @VG]**

### Tournament Scoring System Explanation
The AMD Challenge uses **percentage-based scoring** where all 20 questions are accounted for:

**Score Format**: (q1, a2) vs (a1, q2)

**Where:**
- **q1**: Questions Team A asked that Team B answered incorrectly (%)
- **a2**: Answers Team A provided correctly to Team B's questions (%)
- **a1**: Answers Team B provided correctly to Team A's questions (%)
- **q2**: Questions Team B asked that Team A answered incorrectly (%)

**Key Relationships:**
- q1 + a1 = 100% (all Team A questions accounted for)
- q2 + a2 = 100% (all Team B questions accounted for)

**Final Team Score**: (1st inning score) + (2nd inning score)

**Example Calculation:**
- If Team A scores (90, 100) vs Team B scores (10, 0)
- Team A final: 90.0 + 100.0 = **190.0**
- Team B final: 10.0 + 0.0 = **10.0**
- = 190-10 point differential!

### Personal Achievement Validation

##### Tournament Agent Prompts - Actual Implementation

**Question Agent System Prompts:**

**Advanced System Prompt (wadvsys=true):**
```python
question_system_prompt = """CRITICAL: You MUST generate questions with LOGICALLY SOUND, VERIFIABLE answers and explanations.

VERIFICATION REQUIREMENTS:
1. CORRECT ANSWER must be DEFINITELY TRUE based on the question constraints
2. EXPLANATION must LOGICALLY prove why the answer is correct through systematic deduction
3. ALL DISTRACTORS must be PLAUSIBLE but CLEARLY WRONG when analyzed against constraints
4. Questions must have ONE IRREFUTABLE SOLUTION requiring analytical reasoning

IMPORTANT: Your ONLY job is to output VALID JSON. START your response WITH { and END with }. NO text before or after JSON.

Generate one perfect logical reasoning MCQ as this EXACT JSON:
{"topic": "Seating Arrangements/Circular or Blood Relations/Family Tree", "question": "Logically constrained question with definite answer?", "choices": ["A)...", "B)...", "C)...", "D)..."], "answer": "A/B/C/D", "explanation": "Logical proof showing why this answer is correct"}

SEATING FOCUS: Circular geometry, positioning relationships, adjacency constraints. NO counting problems.
BLOOD RELATIONS FOCUS: Family relationships, generations, marriage connections, inheritance logic.

PROTOCOL: Design question ‚Üí Verify correct answer ‚Üí Ensure distractors fail logic ‚Üí Confirm explanation proves correctness.

OUTPUT ONLY JSON OBJECT - NOTHING ELSE."""
```

**Standard System Prompt (wadvsys=false):**
```python
basic_question_prompt = """You are a world-class logical reasoning expert with an IQ of 170, specializing in creating extremely challenging multiple-choice questions for elite competitive examinations. Your questions test the most sophisticated levels of analytical thinking and logical deduction."""
```

**Question Agent Template with Verification Protocol:**
```python
question_template = """Generate an EXTREMELY DIFFICULT MCQ on the topic: {topic}.

**CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:**
1. **Topic Alignment**: The "question" must be strictly relevant to the topic: {topic}
2. **Question Quality**: The question must be EXTREMELY DIFFICULT, clear, and test deep conceptual understanding. Avoid trivial or ambiguous questions.
3. **Choices (4 total)**: Generate exactly FOUR multiple-choice options, labeled "A)", "B)", "C)", and "D)".
4. **Single Correct Answer**: Ensure that option {correct_option} is only factually correct.
5. **Plausible Distractors**: While option {distractors} are three incorrect UNIQUE choices which are highly plausible and common misconceptions related to the topic, designed to mislead someone without expert knowledge.
6. **Answer Key**: The "answer" field in the JSON should be ONLY the letter {answer}.
7. **Explanation**: The "explanation" field provides a concise (under 100 words) and clear justification for why the correct answer is correct.

{icl_examples}

RESPONSE FORMAT: Strictly generate a valid JSON object ensuring proper syntax and structure as shown below.

EXAMPLE: {topic}
{{
  "topic": "{topic_name}",
  "question": "...",
  "choices": ["A) ...", "B) ...", "C) ...", "D) ..."],
  "answer": "{answer}",
  "explanation": "Provide a brief explanation why {answer} is correct within 100 words."
}}"""
```

**Answer Agent System Prompts:**

**Primary Answer System Prompt (select_prompt1=true):**
```python
answer_sys_prompt_1 = """You are an expert-level logical reasoning specialist who carefully analyzes questions and can identify correct answers through systematic thinking.

INSTRUCTIONS:
1. Read the question, choices, and explanation carefully
2. Analyze the logical relationships and constraints
3. Use expert-level understanding to determine which answer choice follows logically
4. Consider the step-by-step reasoning and conclusion
5. Choose the answer that makes the most logical sense

Output JSON only: {"answer": "LETTER", "reasoning": "Your analysis and conclusion"}"""
```

**Secondary Answer System Prompt (select_prompt1=false):**
```python
answer_sys_prompt_2 = """You are a world-class reasoning expert. Analyze the provided question, choices, and explanation as an expert would.

STEP-BY-STEP APPROACH:
1. Study the question thoroughly
2. Examine each choice option critically
3. Consider the logical explanation provided
4. Apply expert reasoning to determine the correct choice
5. Conclude with the logically sound answer

Output format: {"answer": "LETTER", "reasoning": "Expert analysis conclusion"}"""
```

**Answer Agent Template with Full Context:**
```python
answer_template = """EXPERT ANALYSIS ASSIGNMENT:

QUESTION: {question}

CHOICES: {choices}

EXPLANATION: {explanation}

TASK: Based on your expert-level logical reasoning and analysis of the question, choices, and explanation, determine which option (A/B/C/D) is logically correct and provide your reasoning.

OUTPUT JSON ONLY: {{"answer": "LETTER", "reasoning": "Brief expert analysis conclusion"}}"""
```

### 5. Tournament Integration

#### Agent Initialization
```python
# Load fine-tuned model
model = AutoPeftModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained(
    "./logical_reasoning_final",
    torch_dtype=torch.bfloat16,
    device_map="auto"
)

tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained("./logical_reasoning_final")

# Initialize agents with optimized configurations
question_agent = QuestioningAgent(
    model=model,
    tokenizer=tokenizer,
    temperature=0.7,
    max_tokens=1024
)

answer_agent = AnsweringAgent(
    model=model,
    tokenizer=tokenizer,
    temperature=0.5,
    max_tokens=512
)

# Tournament compliance verification
assert validate_agent_formats(question_agent, answer_agent), "Format validation failed"
assert benchmark_response_times(question_agent, answer_agent), "Performance requirements not met"
```
